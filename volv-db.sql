It&#8217;s a big part of our business. And I think it&#8217;s like WordPress is a big part of all the hosting company, company’s, businesses, you know? So for us, it is like, we want to make it better. We want to give back. We want to understand, you know, where we can contribute the most. And we see it as a, you know, win, win, win situation for everyone, for clients, for the whole ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for us as a business, of course!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Milana Cap </strong>00:00:32]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite WordPress component is WP CLI. That&#8217;s my crush, haha, because I love terminal. I love doing it. I&#8217;m not a really UI type of person, I get lost in UI. But in terminal, you just type command and it does what you want. And a WP CLI is much more powerful than WordPress dashboard. You can do so many things there and you can have fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, so that&#8217;s my go-to tool!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:10]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello everyone. And welcome to the WordPress Briefing– the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:36]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many, many people were at WordCamp Europe a couple of weeks ago. And at the end, Matt and I closed out the event sessions with a little question and answer time from the community. I was excited to see everyone and excited to answer their questions. But as with all spur of the moment answers, I experienced this <em>l&#8217;esprit de l&#8217;escalier </em>and I found that there were a few things that I would have answered a little more completely if I had taken more than two seconds to think about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So today I&#8217;m going to augment some of the answers from that session with a little more context and clarity. There was a question from Laura Byrne about favorite blocks in recent WordPress releases. And given that I was exclusively holding WordCamp Europe information in my brain at the time, I couldn&#8217;t think of which block was my favorite. While I was sitting there on that stage,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I realized that one of my favorite things about WordPress’s 6.0 release, like Matt, wasn&#8217;t really a block, but it was a functional workflow sort of thing. So my favorite thing was the ability to lock blocks, but I mean, the question was about favorite blocks. And so I do know that some of the most anticipated blocks are the Flexbox layout blocks. Whew. What a sentence!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:46]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to say that three times fast! Those blocks are the Flexbox layout blocks, they are sort of shortcuts that show up when you&#8217;re selecting multiple blocks and allow for easy side-by-side layouts. I&#8217;m not explaining it in a way that does it much justice, but I will share a link in the show notes that has more information and you can kind of see how empowering that particular block is in the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next question I wanted to give a little more context to came from Courtney Robertson. She asked about how to make translated content more readily available on learn.wordpress.org. My answer was pretty far ranging and talked about why it&#8217;s harder to commit to prioritizing that over, for my example, translating WordPress core.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also understand that there are people who want to help and just need someone to point them in the right direction. And so I want to be clear that it is possible to have workshops in any language on learn.wordpress.org right now. We just don&#8217;t have a lot of people contributing those translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are conversations going on right now in the training team about using Glotpress on learn.wordpress.org, and also how to translate subtitles. So, if you are looking for ways to give back through translation and training is an important kind of area of your focus. I will have links to both of those things in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:04:11]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also gave a quick answer, uh, after this question about how hard it is to recognize contributions that are separate from a major event or major release. In this case, when I say recognize, that&#8217;s recognized as in thank, not recognize as in, know it exists. In case it&#8217;s not clear why that was connected, why that answer was connected to the question, training materials are self-serve and not always specific to individual releases of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that means the maintenance of any content around training happens routinely over the course of time, rather than because of a specific release or a WordCamp. What sometimes can make it a little harder to entice people to join us in that work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now the third question I&#8217;d like to tackle is the one that came from Megan Rose. She asked how we can encourage better diversity as we go back to in-person events. My answer was more about the big picture, program-wide work that has been done and specific awarenesses that I, as a leader, have been keeping top of mind. That answer is still true and is still important, but again, it doesn&#8217;t really help anyone who&#8217;s wondering how they can show up today in their own communities, and do the hard work of fostering an inclusive space there so that we can confidently welcome more diverse voices together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:05:27]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great place to start is to have conversations with people who aren&#8217;t like you and really listen. Also recognizing that we all come from different backgrounds that give us more or less opportunity and always be asking yourself, who is missing from this conversation and why, how can I find them and invite them into our own WordPress spaces?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that all kind of feels right up your alley, I would check out the show notes. I&#8217;ll have some links in there to the community team’s site, as well as a few posts that will help you to explore that a bit further as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were also a couple of questions about market share slash usage of WordPress, and Five for the Future that I really do want to answer, but as I was writing up the context and just kind of exploring the questions that people were raising, it turned out to really be quite a big set of answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I will do those in either two separate episodes of their own or one surprisingly long, for me, episode. And so there you have it, a lightning round, deep dive on a few questions from WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Jonathan Desrosiers </strong>00:06:41]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s definitely great to be back in person. Um, it&#8217;s been a long two years, two or three years for a lot of people and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s great that we&#8217;re such an asynchronous community and we can all stay connected online through Slack and different means. Um, but there are some things that you can&#8217;t replace, like making friends with people and learning people&#8217;s demeanors and having some discussions in person that you can&#8217;t replace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, uh, I&#8217;m really excited to see people I haven&#8217;t seen in a long time. Meet new people and, um, you know, have some of those discussions here today in Portugal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:07:21]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which then brings us to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you missed the announcement, WordCamp Europe will be in Athens next year. And the call for organizers is open already. It&#8217;s an experience that is absolutely irreplaceable. So I&#8217;ll link to that in the show notes, in case you&#8217;ve always wanted to give back to WordPress that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on my list is that work on the next major release of WordPress is already underway. There is a post with roadmap info that was published recently, as well as a slightly more casual thread on Twitter. I&#8217;ve linked both of those in the show notes, so that you have some concept of what it is that we are aiming for in 6.1, and also a concept of where to go to get started working on it if that&#8217;s what you feel like doing, uh, for the next three to four months– 120 days, roughly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and finally. This is less of like a thing to be aware of in the next two weeks and kind of a little WordPress project tool tip. Did you know that we have a calendar that shows all meetings for all teams all week long? It will make you feel tired by the amount of work that gets done in the WordPress project every week, but it&#8217;s right there on make.wordpress.org/meetings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you never have to wonder where folks are meeting to talk about things ever again. And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Santana Inniss &amp; Héctor Prieto </strong>00:09:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello!

She recalls: “No one thought to say, ‘Dee, you look like you’re good at this, you should pursue it…’. I mean, I was a girl (and I was told girls didn’t ‘do’ computers). No one in the circles I moved in really had any idea where this technology revolution would take us.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With no particular career path into technology, Dee was encouraged in her final year of school to apply for a job in a bank where she worked and became a teller three years later. She gained financial independence, which enabled her to travel as a 20-year-old and spend the next three years exploring the US and Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, she noted how the world had changed: the first computer mouse she had seen had come out in 1983, and 20 years later WordPress was founded.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Journey into coding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During those 20 years, Dee worked as a nanny, working in child care centers, in customer support, and as a temp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1999, she packed up her bags once again, and moved from New Zealand to Australia. She took a place at a performing arts school where she honed her singing and performance skills and volunteered her time to the music director who was starting to experiment with sending out HTML newsletters and updates via email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And so my personal revolution began. On the day after I graduated from that course, I walked into a full-time role as that music director’s assistant and began my journey back to code.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of that job, Dee edited and sent HTML newsletters on a weekly basis. This ignited her interest in programming, and she bought books about coding for the web and experimented on her home-built PC making web pages. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“I’m sure, like a lot of us, I remember the thrill of creating that first HTML file and seeing a ‘Hello World’ or similar heading rendered in the browser. From there, I was completely hooked.”</p><cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Later she moved to the IT department and took on maintenance of all the websites. By 2004, she was working full-time as a webmaster. A year later, she was running a small business creating sites on the side. Four years after that, her business became her full-time job as she left employment to pursue her Masters Degree in Digital Communication and Culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee with other contributors getting things ready for a WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-12961\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Dee and other volunteers setting up for a local WordCamp</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee found the theory and sociology behind the web, and its facilitation of human and machine communication fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I love the fact that the tech industry involves a constant constant curve of growth and discovery, which results in a perpetual exercise in finding creative elegant solutions for sticky problems.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Dee, being able to use her innate curiosity to leverage processes, people, and tools, fuelled by a focus on communicating a message, has been a defining inspiration in her work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combined fascination coincided with her meeting WordPress in 2009 and subsequently its community. She moved her existing blog to the software and it became the CMS of choice for all her client work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The WordPress community can change your world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, she stumbled across WordCamps and by extension the WordPress community. Dee has reflected publicly that WordPress didn’t change her life, its community changed her world!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She flew on a whim from her then home in Sydney to attend a WordCamp in Melbourne she had found after a search for ‘WordPress Conferences’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I met welcoming people, made friends, connected, and came back home excited and hopeful about continuing this connection with the wider WordPress community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a community locally around WordPress got off to a slow start in Sydney. From an inauspicious early WordPress Sydney meetup in the function room of a pub, her connection and involvement took off. Before long she was helping organize that meetup, and by the time she moved away from that great city it had branched into two meetups, and soon after, into three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was so inspired by the community that at the end of that first year and her second WordCamp, she raised her hand to help organize a WordCamp Sydney in 2012, and after moving interstate, WordCamp Melbourne in 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.&#8221;</p><cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee said: “WordPress, software, technology, the Internet will come and go, morph, and change, evolve. Maybe WordPress will last forever, maybe it will morph into something else, maybe one day it will look completely different than it did when I first started (actually, that’s true now). The thing that doesn’t change is the humanity around it. WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: “The thing that I have learned, not only through WordPress but in life, is that if we too serve the people around what we’re doing, we ourselves will grow, develop and change alongside the people we serve, and the tools we use to serve them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"329\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee pictured second from left as part of the WordPress 5.6 contributors\" class=\"wp-image-12957\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=300%2C96&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=768%2C246&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Some of the contributors to the <em>WordPress 5.6 release</em> </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee was a coordinator for WordPress 5.6 release in 2020 and was able to encourage others to learn about the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Helping others and sharing knowledge through WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee has been an advocate for cross-cultural collaboration and understanding in both WordPress and her work for a large distributed agency which has people from more than 24 countries and operates across 16 timezones.

It’s those connections, it’s the friendships. It’s the network of work, referrals, support, help, encouragement that has kept me wired into this community and committed to helping other people find that connection and growth for themselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee’s career in WordPress has moved through coding, into project management of large scale WordPress projects, and now into delivery leadership. Her connections to community have helped &#8216;fuel the transitions&#8217; through these chapters of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I believe that the place I’ve found and the opportunities I have had owe as much to my own desire and ambition as they do to the help, support and belief of the community around me; sometimes even more than I’ve felt in myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She feels that she is ‘living proof’ that by helping, connecting, and resourcing other people, you can be helped, resourced and connected into places you had never thought possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has enabled her to reach and have a career in technology that she did not know existed as a teenager playing with that first computer mouse and experimenting with code. Dee hopes her story will inspire others in their journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"share-the-stories\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>), Mary Baum (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>), Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>), Nalini Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>), and Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>) for work on this feature.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it. As well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the approach of various mid-year breaks and the prospect of wandering off for some safe, restorative travel, I&#8217;ve been updating my to-read and re-read list. As I was looking at the queued books for my Northern hemisphere summer, there were some common threads, mostly around leadership, but there&#8217;s also like a chunk that&#8217;s about cross-cultural group theory and economics, and then like some beach reads, but there&#8217;s one group in particular that you all might find interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s a group that&#8217;s sort of like a back-to-FOSS basics list. So I&#8217;ll share my top few with you in case you want to pack a copy for your next getaway.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one on our list is called Producing Open Source Software by Karl Fogel. I think everyone who contributes to FOSS projects has received this as one of their first recommendations. Like, y&#8217;all are building open software? Excellent, you need to read Producing Open Source Software. Like, that is just a sentence that comes out of everyone&#8217;s mouths. So this was one of the first open source books that was recommended to me when I joined the WordPress community. It was freshly revised in 2020, and I haven&#8217;t given it a read since then, which is why it is on my reread list this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it shaped the early days of the WordPress project’s leadership, and their lead developers, and some of WordPress&#8217;s basic philosophies. It&#8217;s all available online, under a creative commons, ShareAlike license. And so it&#8217;s worth the read. I&#8217;ll put a link to it in the show notes so it&#8217;s easy for everyone to find in the event that is your preferred beach read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one on this list is a book from Nadia Eghbal. She wrote the excellent Roads and Bridges report that also is probably not light beach reading, but you know, this one is on my list to read this summer because Eghbal always delivers truths about the reality of maintaining popular software, popular, open source software, in a way that&#8217;s easy for me to access and process rather than getting paralyzed by the enormity of it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth your mileage may vary on that. I realized that, like, I live and breathe open source stuff. And so just because I am not paralyzed by the enormity of her explanations of things doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that you will have a similar experience. And so I&#8217;m just going to claim that elephant in the room for all of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you only read one book on this list this year, I think that this should be the one that you read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:14]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third one is called Code: Collaborative Ownership and the Digital Economy. It was edited by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh. I am certain that I butchered that name. And so I apologize on my own behalf to everyone that knows whether or not I said it correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This book focuses on intellectual property rights and the original purpose of having anything like copyright in the world. So, right up my alley! The writers who contributed to this work promise exploration of the plight of creativity in the commons, the role of sharing in creative advancement, and a concept of what it would look like if intellectual property were to mean the second closing of an ecosystem versus a triumph of the commons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, obviously, this one is very light reading. You can take this topic to high tea and everyone will not know what you&#8217;re talking about. However, this one looks like a really interesting book to me and I am just super ready to read it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second to last one on the list is a book called Humble Inquiry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a new-to-me book that seems right in line with one of my favorite books to recommend to leaders in the open source space. From reviews of it, I have gathered that it takes a hard look at the value of listening and asking for clarification in a world that puts a high value on an unsolicited hot take.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It puts the importance of high trust relationship building, which is at the heart of any cross-culturally aware organization. And for folks who&#8217;ve been working with me for a while, you know, that relationship building is an important part of my leadership expectations for myself. So it puts relationship building at the front and center with a promise of practical applications for everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you ever have tried to tackle a complicated topic like this, you know that practical applications are really hard to come by and it&#8217;s often hard to understand it if you don&#8217;t have those practical applications. And so that is why this one is on my read and reread list this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:24]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then finally the WordPress Milestones book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this sounds like a shameless plug for WordPress. And on the one hand, this whole podcast is about WordPress. And so, yes! But on the other hand, I actually am reading this for two specific reasons. I&#8217;m rereading this actually. I read it when I first joined Automattic. And so the first of the two reasons that I&#8217;m rereading it this year is that volume two of this is, like the second decade of WordPress currently, being researched and written in preparation for WordPress’s 20th birthday next year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I am rereading this to kind of get that all back in my mind as that work is getting done. And the second reason is that I honestly like to remind myself of how far we&#8217;ve come sometimes. I talk about our work frequently. And I talk about what we&#8217;re working on right now, all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I talk about what we&#8217;re looking at three years from now, five years from now. The biggest concerns of today, tomorrow, and the future-future. And it&#8217;s very easy to forget how much success WordPress has had and how much growth the contributors that support us have had over the course of our long and storied history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:40]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I like to go back to that just to kind of give myself some grounding in our progress, as well as get some concept for how we can move forward together. So that one is also available online. Also under a creative commons ShareAlike license and it is also worth the read. I will share a link to that with the other one in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. Let&#8217;s see what we got in the old lineup today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, firstly WordCamp Europe is happening this week and it&#8217;s possible to watch the live stream from the comfort of your own home. There are some smart and talented speakers at the event. So I encourage you to catch a few if you have the time. I&#8217;ll include a link to the live stream information in the show notes below, and then also you can always keep an eye out on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be a lot of discussions, a lot of conversation there. And so you can engage with folks that are there at the time and catch up on those conversations, catch up on those presentations in your own time, as it fits into your day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:50]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WordPress’s community team is preparing the annual meetup survey right now. So if you participate in meetup events, keep an eye out for that because your feedback helps us to make plans to improve that program so that it works better for you. And it helps you to learn WordPress better and feel more confident with what you are taking out into the world that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, if you are wanting to use this as a chance to contribute, we actually will need folks who are able to translate the surveys as well. So I&#8217;ll leave a link to some information about that in the show notes. If all of that stuff about contribution didn&#8217;t make any sense, then just like keep an eye out from your meetup organizer and they will make sure that you have that survey so that you can have your voice heard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then item three is less of an item. I mean, it&#8217;s an item cause it&#8217;s in this list, but it&#8217;s less of, like, a thing to know and more of a general thing to be aware of. It&#8217;s a general awareness item. There&#8217;s a lot going on in WordPress right now. I can see how hard it is to keep track of some of these things these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know as someone who&#8217;s looking at this all day every day that, yeah, it&#8217;s a lot. And it&#8217;s hard to get your bearings. So if you have a team that you contribute to already, don&#8217;t forget to reach out to each other, just to check-in. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to ask for help. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to offer help and you know, if no one needs any help from you at that moment, a little hello also can brighten someone&#8217;s day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your smallest of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12940\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:26:\"WordPress 6.0 “Arturo”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/05/arturo/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 24 May 2022 20:01:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12879\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:278:\"Say hello to “Arturo” and WordPress 6.0, inspired by Grammy-winning jazz musician, Arturo O’Farrill.

This expands the new Style system even further and enables shortcuts to switch the look and feel of your site all within a single theme. In block themes that support this feature, you can change both the available settings, like the font-weight, and the style options, like the default color palette.

These additional templates provide greater flexibility for content creators. Tailor each with the tools you already know or with the following new options in this release:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Featured images can be used in the cover block.</li><li>New featured image sizing controls make it easier to get the results you want.</li><li>While editing a template, at the root, or between blocks, the quick inserter shows you patterns and template parts to help you work faster and discover new layout options.</li><li>The query block supports filtering on multiple authors, support for custom taxonomies, and support for customizing what is shown when there are no results.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Browsing footer patterns in the quick inserter\" class=\"wp-image-12890\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Integrated-Patterns.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Integrated Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns will now appear when you need them in even more places, like in the quick inserter or when creating a new header or footer. If you’re a block theme author, you can even <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-patterns/\">register patterns from the Pattern Directory using `<code>theme.json</code>`</a>, enabling you to prioritize specific patterns that are most helpful to your theme’s users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Additional Design Tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Design tools grow more powerful and intuitive with each release. Some highlights for 6.0 include:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A new color panel design saves space, but still shows your options at a glance.&nbsp;</li><li>New border controls offer a simpler way to set your border exactly as you like it.&nbsp;</li><li>Transparency levels for your colors allow for even more creative color options.</li><li>Control gaps, margins, typography, and more on a collection of blocks, all at once, in the Group block.</li><li>Switch between stack, row, and group variations to position groups of blocks with more layout flexibility.</li><li>Use the gap support functionality in the Gallery block to create different looks – from adding spacing between all images, to removing spacing altogether.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Selecting multiple blocks in the list view\" class=\"wp-image-12891\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/List-view.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Better List View</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>New keyboard shortcuts enable you to select multiple blocks from the list view, modify them in bulk, and drag and drop them within the list. List View can be opened and closed easily; it comes collapsed by default and it automatically expands to the current selection whenever you select a block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1204\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?fit=1204%2C700&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Unlocking the block in the block toolbar\" class=\"wp-image-12892\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?w=1204&amp;ssl=1 1204w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=1024%2C595&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Block-Locking-Controls.png?resize=768%2C447&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Locking Controls</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can lock your blocks. Choose to disable the option to move a block, remove a block, or both. This simplifies project handover, allowing your clients to unleash their creativity without worrying about accidentally breaking their site in the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Improved Performance in WordPress 6.0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This release includes several updates focused on improving the performance of WordPress.

Community translators continue after a release ensuring more translations are on their way. Thank you to everyone who helps to make WordPress available in 205 languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many thanks to all of the community volunteers who contribute to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/\">support forums</a> by answering questions from WordPress users around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If contributing to WordPress appeals to you, it’s easy to learn more and get involved.

The project believes great software should work with minimum setup, so you can focus on sharing your story, product, or services freely. The basic WordPress software is simple and predictable so you can easily get started.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Y&#8217;all, we&#8217;ve got an absolutely jam-packed couple of weeks in WordPress. We&#8217;ve got events happening and releases shipping and contributor days being coordinated (I almost said contributor days being contributed). That&#8217;s also what they&#8217;re doing. I&#8217;ll share some of those highlights in today&#8217;s small list of big things, but I did want to specifically call out something that&#8217;s coming up this week on Thursday (May 19, 2022), and that something is Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team of contributors over on the Accessibility team has participated in the Global Accessibility Awareness Day in the past. So I thought it would be interesting to hear from one of the co-founders of this particular day of awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:27]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. And with that, Joe Devin, would you like to tell us a little bit more about yourself?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:01:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure. So I am the co-founder of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which is a day that goes viral every year on the third Thursday of May. We typically have the Twitter reach on the GAAD hashtag on Twitter of 200 million users, which is, I think, pretty much their active user count. We stopped counting once we hit their daily active user count. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, I am Chair of the GAAD Foundation, which we launched last year. And then I have a day job too, where I&#8217;m CEO and co-founder of Diamond, which is an inclusive digital agency that builds software accessibly by default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:15]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wonderful. Well, we are so excited to have you today. I said we like it&#8217;s me and the mouse in my pocket—we in the WordPress community that&#8217;s going to listen to this. Super excited to have you today. So you mentioned GAAD, Global Accessibility Awareness Day. Last year was your 10th anniversary, which is very exciting, but like with so many good things, I hear it all started with a blog post and a blog post on WordPress, no less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;d love to hear about how GAAD evolved from that, with, as I understand it, your co-founder of Jennison (Asuncion). That must be where you met him, I assume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:02:51] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Yes. So what happened was I started a WordPress blog called <em>My SQL Talk</em>. So it&#8217;s a database blog, and I just thought it was a brilliant name. I mean, My SQL Talk, like that, should be super popular.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it probably had maybe ten people who ever looked. Um, and then my dad was getting older, and my dad was a survivor of the concentration camps, and he was a genius. He spoke ten languages. It, he was one of those people. That, when he walked into a room, he just commanded respect. You knew that there was history. I don&#8217;t know how to explain it really, but it was special when my dad walked into the room. And considering all of this that he suffered in his life, watching him get older and struggle, particularly with his banking, was very painful to see. And the bank wasn&#8217;t accessible, so I wrote this blog post proposing that we create a Global Accessibility Awareness Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes I get these visions, and they never turn into anything. But while I think about it, I&#8217;m like, &#8220;all right, let&#8217;s write this blog post and this can definitely work. Right?&#8221; And then you finish the blog post to hit send, and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;this is not going to work.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I wasn&#8217;t even smart enough to do social media on it. But fortunately, WordPress had an auto-tweet feature, and it tweeted it out, and Jennison Asuncion, my co-founder, happened to be around and not out that Saturday night. And he read the blog post, and he said, &#8220;this is a great idea. Let&#8217;s make it happen.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we had two busy people, but we both had a community. He had the accessibility community, and I was building a tech scene in Los Angeles. And what I discovered is if you combine a great idea with the community, great things can happen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:49]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh man, you&#8217;re speaking my language over here, helping people find their communities, knowing that community is the thing that is the lifeblood of society.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That sounded like a tautology. It is not a tautology. You can have a society with an attempt to not have any sort of community around it, but I bet it doesn&#8217;t work very well. Well, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s very interesting. And so you all just kind of talked through what that would look like, I assume in confidence, or that would have to take place, right? Or was it on Twitter in those days?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:05:24]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, you could still look in the comments and see the back and forth of Jennison and a bunch of other people that got pretty involved with GAAD that are some legendary folks in there. It&#8217;s kind of mind-blowing because I dunno how, how you feel, but for me, when I used to code, uh, three months later, I&#8217;d look back at old code and be like, &#8220;oh, I suck,&#8221; you know, or write an email even and you look back on it a day later and are like &#8220;what a stupid email, how stupid am I?&#8221; You know?  But I look back on that one after ten years; I was scared to look at it because I&#8217;m like, it must&#8217;ve been really bad. But you know, it kind of held up, and exactly what I wrote in there happened &#8211; to my utter shock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:06]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, it&#8217;s kinda nice, though, to look back and be like, &#8220;oh, I used to be much dumber.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause then you&#8217;re like, look how far I&#8217;ve come. I&#8217;m no longer that dumb. I&#8217;m a different kind of dumb now; good for me. I always hope to be a different kind of dumb as I go forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then, okay, so that was your ten-year anniversary last year. GAAD, in general, now has been going on for 11 years, and at the time of this recording, in a couple of weeks, but then probably a week when it finally publishes, you have your next, your next round of that going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it seems safe to assume that awareness of the need for accessibility has increased during that time, but we all know that the work of accessibility is ongoing. And so, I&#8217;m just curious to hear from your perspective if the awareness of the need for accessibility has generally started to permeate developer communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And are you seeing more developer awareness around the need for accessibility in tech in general?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:07:12]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. You know, it&#8217;s not enough. It&#8217;s certainly improved a lot.  I keynoted a conference probably four years after GAAD started, maybe five, and I kind of assumed nobody would have heard of accessibility, and I was taken aback when I asked who had heard of it, and a good chunk of the room had. So even then, there had been a difference, and I&#8217;d say now I see accessibility mentioned a lot more in conferences and stuff. But when it comes to actually building it, there&#8217;s a tremendous amount of ignorance. There, there still needs to be a lot more awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think partially people are a little bit scared to dip their toe because they&#8217;re scared that they&#8217;re going to be told that &#8220;no, it&#8217;s not accessible,&#8221; or that they&#8217;re going to say the wrong word or offend somebody. So I&#8217;d say that there&#8217;s some degree of trepidation, but also developers, and it&#8217;s not just developers, designers, and product people. There&#8217;s so much to learn, and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;oh God, there&#8217;s another piece that I have to learn.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m so glad that you invited me on this podcast because it&#8217;s the developers that, you know, I am a developer, not anymore, I haven&#8217;t touched code in years, but that&#8217;s where I came from. Right? This is my peach, right? Particularly WordPress folks, because I had done a fair bit of WordPress before I moved on to some other things. And, I think we have to talk about usability and understand that accessibility is so much more than how we look at disability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t mind, I&#8217;m going to ask you a question. How do you think the typical WordPress developer or designer would define disability? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:05] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>in the kinds of conversations that I&#8217;ve had over the years, it frequently has to do with visual things. Because it&#8217;s just screens all day, right? And that&#8217;s a primary area where our designers and developers really have made some effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But my personal favorite sort of, of example, for like, when you&#8217;re looking at how to make sure that your products are accessible is, what, if you have to use your website, or you have to build your website using only one arm. Because that gives you an opportunity to kind of look at disability from a permanent standpoint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like if you have lost permanent use of one arm, but also gives you an opportunity to look at the temporary options for that sort of lack of mobility. Like you&#8217;re a mother with an infant, and so you have to be able to, you know, get your stuff done with one arm. And so I know that we paid a bunch of attention to screen readers and what works in not way back in 2018 and 2019 did a lot of work with. Literally zero screen. And can you still do the thing that you need to do, which was incredibly difficult. And I was really excited to see what our developers came up with around that. But I think that that is quite a bit of that discussion as we&#8217;re going through it from the beginning to the&nbsp;end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:27] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I mean, that&#8217;s a great answer, and you definitely understand some of the nuances way better than I think that the average creator, digital product creator, I&#8217;m including the, you know, the product people, the designers, and the developers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re very fortunate to have more than just developers in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:10:50]  </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason I bring this up is that the WHO (World Health Organization) had to; they&#8217;re the ones that did massive research across the globe. And they had to, they had to come up with a definition, and in their definition, they needed to draw a line. Typically, I don&#8217;t remember the exact thing cause it&#8217;s a 350-page report, and I kept looking for where they defined it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a little hard to find, but essentially it&#8217;s if there&#8217;s a major disability or a disability that impacts some significant portion of your day-to-day activities. And that&#8217;s really great when you&#8217;re trying to do a report on how many disabilities there are out there; what percentage of the population has a disability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And their figures are something like 15% of the population has a disability, which is a huge number. But at the same time, they also mentioned that 2.2 billion people have a visual impairment. And we also know that over 33% of the population is over 50, and I&#8217;m included in that population. And I can say that when you&#8217;re over 50, you know, I&#8217;ve got clouds in my eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know where they came from, but they definitely make it harder to see. When I&#8217;m in a restaurant, I can&#8217;t focus on the person across from me the same way. My hearing is not the same, and anybody over 50 is going to have certain impairments and won&#8217;t see as well; color contrast issues are a big deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to raise the font is a big deal. And I think that accessibility is connected in most people&#8217;s minds with disability. And they&#8217;ll attach that to something like being blind or being deaf or hard of hearing or having a missing limb or having some other kind of disability. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, I don&#8217;t even know any people in that category possibly,&#8221; and as a result, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;well, how important is this?&#8221; Yes. They might feel guilty. I should do the right thing. This is the right thing to do. But honestly, like how much money should I spend on it? How much, what percentage of my time should I spend on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t realize that everybody has different abilities. And so, I&#8217;m starting to go away from even talking about disabilities and asking people to remember that all of us perceive things differently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you remember the gold dress where they were trying to say, what color is this dress? Is it gold and white or blue and black? And it is blue and black, but to me, all I see is gold and white. And then there was Laurel or Yanny. Do you remember that?. And some people heard it, and typically older people heard it as Laurel, and I&#8217;ve, and I do this in some of my presentations. I play that, that sound. And usually, it&#8217;s Laurel for me, but sometimes it&#8217;s Yanny. Even personally, it changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, we have a totally different perception. Now think about memory. There&#8217;s a different kind of blindness. If you try and remember, let&#8217;s say a relative or a friend that is no longer. How well do you see that picture?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because for me, it is very, very vague, but for some people, they say, and I&#8217;ve been asking people, and I&#8217;d love your answer as well. How vivid is it? And some people say, I can read the, I can see the pattern on the shirt. It&#8217;s as vivid as if I see with opening my eyes, seeing, you know, the regular in front of me, and I can even read a name tag in the memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, Woah, so maybe I&#8217;m blind in a way. Right? So how do you see it? How do you remember things?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I&#8217;m a, I&#8217;m a real visual person and a tactile person. And so, like if I interacted with someone, I&#8217;m very likely to be able to picture, like, recreate that mental picture pretty well in my mind. I recently, very recently, met some of my first people in that executive leadership space who were like, yeah, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t visualize things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was like, what are you, how do you do this work? Because like, you have to be able to do that. And they were like, no, I don&#8217;t have mental pictures.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some people don&#8217;t have an inner dialogue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:17] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t understand that either,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:15:19] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Me either. So accessibility studies all of these differences with respect to how you&#8217;re presenting all of this information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t pay attention to accessibility, you&#8217;re really just missing out. And then there&#8217;s colorblindness. If you&#8217;re creating something like slack that has an online/offline indicator, and you only use red and green for people who are colorblind, they see gray and gray. And so what I&#8217;m trying to teach the community with digital product creators is that no, you cannot ignore it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can ignore accessibility, but then you&#8217;re not good at your job. I mean, I don&#8217;t mean to say it in an offensive way, but you&#8217;re not good at your job if you&#8217;re unaware. If you break a rule on purpose, great. But if you don&#8217;t know the rule, it&#8217;s just a lack of craft, and you absolutely should make it a priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re not doing it as a charity. You&#8217;re doing it because you care about your users, and you care about your craft, and you want to build things well, and it&#8217;s a necessity. And I think that this is the kind of message that our community needs to hear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:31]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to touch on something that you sort of brought up a bit, um, at the start of the answer there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you brought up the concept of usability. And in the last time that I did a podcast about accessibility, I defined accessibility as a subset of usability. Do you think that if we were to consistently draw that line for people so that it&#8217;s not just like accessibility is this thing that you should do outside of usability?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we were to more consistently draw that line, do you think that that would help people to see and understand better that its shades of existence, usability, and accessibility?  &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:17:10] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, 100%, a hundred percent. And in my company, we kind of realized that that&#8217;s exactly what we have to do. We have to see this as usability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t, we talk about accessibility a lot, but I don&#8217;t want to. It&#8217;s part of the plumbing for us. We&#8217;ve made it part of the plumbing, and I can tell you it&#8217;s a struggle to take accessibility and make it part of an organization, even when you&#8217;re bringing it top-down, believe it or not. For our teams, particularly the designers, they are blown away by what they&#8217;re learning because they&#8217;re improving their craft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And design is typically where there&#8217;s a struggle to get accessibility accepted because there seems to be a very strong idea of what a design should look like. And I think it&#8217;s really about the approach because UX and design it&#8217;s all about empathy for people. And when you approach it, not as, even though empathy should mean that, that, you know, do the right thing at the same time, it&#8217;s more about empathy for your user, and your user includes so much more than just people with disabilities that you haven&#8217;t run into somebody that has that disability and therefore you build it better, and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s completely blown their mind. They love it. They love doing it. And I&#8217;m not hiring people with accessibility coming in. We&#8217;re training them to work accessibly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:18:34] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it&#8217;s interesting that you talk about empathy as part of being able to make sure that you&#8217;re creating something that&#8217;s accessible because I actually feel like empathy is. Like it&#8217;s being considered this gold standard for many, many things right now. And I think it actually is more harmful in the long run than instead making altruistic choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, I have a blog post that I will link in our show notes that will kind of help everybody see more fully my concept there. But when you rely on empathy, you do kind of have to rely on one, being able to run into all of the issues you were mentioning. You have to know people who have problems in order to know that the problems exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you also kind of have to assume that once you have willingly put yourself into the discomfort of that kind of disability, whatever, wherever it exists on that spectrum, your experience of that discomfort is the same as someone who lives with it. And I just don&#8217;t think that we can necessarily do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I always think that trying to do the altruistic thing, like doing your research and figuring out what it is and trying to make decisions on behalf of other people as best you can, which is a terrible thing. Still, like decisions that take into account the experiences that people are sharing with you and then going to them and saying, &#8220;does this make that experience better or worse?&#8221; is the more sustainable option from my perspective, this is specifically leadership. Still, I think it&#8217;s true for accessibility as well, and probably product design as a whole, but it&#8217;s very difficult. Like people really feel like they understand the concept of empathy right now. And I do think that sometimes that leads us down the wrong path for things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s your thought on that? I think you kind of agree based on what your answer was&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:20:33]</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, no, absolutely. And you know, we, you, can&#8217;t never about us without us, as the common saying, and we&#8217;ve gathered a group of a hundred people with a wide variety of disabilities for research. Whenever we do any UX and research, and sometimes we&#8217;re asked to just do research projects, we go out and ask the users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had some really interesting companies approach us to do innovation and accessibility, and they had strong assumptions. We looked at the assumptions and agreed with it, but we&#8217;re like, all right, they were smart. They said, &#8220;vet this with users for us, please,&#8221; because they didn&#8217;t want to gather their own group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We vetted with users, and we&#8217;re blown away, always blown away because there are so many things you just don&#8217;t know unless you&#8217;ve lived with a particular disability. You can&#8217;t guess, and you&#8217;ve got to speak to your users and a wide variety of them. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:21:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. What role does open source play in expanding accessibility, either in specifically the digital space or just accessibility in general?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:21:42] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess if the question is, what role does it play? I would say the role it plays is it is, unfortunately, it makes accessibility worse because, for the most part open source is not very accessible. And it&#8217;s a personal passion of mine, so I&#8217;m really glad that you brought that up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it is so bizarre. You write a blog post and then it goes viral, and it goes viral every year to a degree that you can&#8217;t even believe it, that all these companies that you know are running events. Privately, publicly talking about it. And then you get all these people thanking you for what you&#8217;ve done year after year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then one year, you read on Twitter, The Blind Onion; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re familiar with The Onion, the satirical clip, there&#8217;s the Blind Onion. And they tweet out, &#8220;Now that Global Accessibility Awareness Day is over, we look forward to 364 days of global accessibility oblivion.&#8221; And that really hurt at the time, but at the same time, and I was told to ignore it, don&#8217;t worry about it, but I&#8217;m like, no, this is coming from a place of pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the point of GAAD was to make a difference. It wasn&#8217;t too to just give everybody an opportunity to say, &#8220;Hey, look at what we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; and then not make a difference. So, as a result of that, I started to think about, well, where are we with this? And, and so I&#8217;ve created a state of accessibility report that through my company, we&#8217;re able to run for a few years, and it&#8217;s not, you know, the state is not great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, well, what can we do to change things? So, as a result of all of this, I really wanted to figure out, well, what can we do to make sure that GAAD does make a difference? And so, I came up with the idea of the GAAD pledge, which is specifically meant for open source frameworks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the idea of the GAAD pledge is that an open source framework, when they are ready, takes the pledge to make accessibility a core value of the framework. Now, terms of what that actually entails are different for every single project because every project is unique. We did create a bit of a framework, which had the idea of saying, okay, you&#8217;re going to, first of all, create an accessibility statement that says that this framework is going to conform to whatever, WCAG, which is Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, to whatever WCAG level is decided and is appropriate for the framework. That there&#8217;s going to be documentation for anybody that is downloading this piece of open source project and trying to implement it, that there should be guidelines for them, that all of the examples should be accessible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really important because even the frameworks that try to pay attention to accessibility. You&#8217;ll often see that people from the community will provide examples, and they&#8217;re inaccessible. And it&#8217;s really sad when you see that because so many people are just copy-pasting. That&#8217;s typically how it works, and they&#8217;re going to copy-paste something bad. So putting a statement around it, I think, would be really great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what we&#8217;re hoping to see is that lots and lots of big open source communities decide to take the pledge. And then it&#8217;ll sort of be table stakes that any new open source projects as well look, all of these frameworks that made it, they took the pledge and therefore we should take the pledge as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the very first year, we had React Native take the pledge, and they put a lot of effort into their accessibility. The second group to take it was Ember.js, and they always put a lot of effort into their accessibility, and they continued that effort. We&#8217;re about to announce the next one, but we&#8217;re still two weeks away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I can&#8217;t say anything yet, but yeah, we&#8217;re, uh, we&#8217;re hoping for a lot more uptake on, on the gap pledge because it, it affects so many people downstream. WordPress&#8217;s what percent of the web right now? 43%? So there you go. That&#8217;s so many people.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:25:57] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So many people. Yeah, fun fact Gutenberg, our current rewriting of the editing experience in WordPress, primarily uses React. And so, I&#8217;m glad to hear that they have taken that pledge as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any good cooking, it starts with good&nbsp;ingredients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:12] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You said it. That was great. I wish I was a cook, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:26:23] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. All right. Let&#8217;s what keeps you up at night when it comes to the state of accessibility?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:26:29] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What keeps me up at night is how to move the needle. It is such a big thing to change. And there are so many angles that you can approach this with, but at the end of the day, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a monster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a monster. There are so many legacy sites out there. If you look at WebAIM, they do a yearly report on the state of accessibility as well. They call it the WebAIM Million, and they&#8217;re typically seeing 97% inaccessible, 98%. It goes up and down a little bit every year. And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s just a huge boat to move.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we need to at least get the newer, uh, newer websites and mobile apps to move. And what we&#8217;ve seen in our state of accessibility report is that only the very top companies seem to put in the effort to make their products accessible. There is a big push with the enterprise companies to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CEOs are starting to talk about it, but what we need is the entire culture of software development to change. Or I should even say digital product development change and to move that boat is massive. And that&#8217;s I put it in my tagline in my email like that&#8217;s my mission in life, and I hope to achieve it before I die.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that keeps me up at night.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:27:52] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that would keep me up at night as well. I mean, it seems like you are really just personally mission-driven and impact-driven. Do you feel like, in the event that the work that you&#8217;ve accomplished so far is what you accomplish, you feel still like you&#8217;ve had an impact?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like you have had&nbsp;an impact. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:13] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not one of those people that tries to have a legacy or like tries to focus on what my impact is and all of that. I just try and do good work. And hopefully, it just shows at the end of the day. I&#8217;m just trying to have the impact without the accolades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:34]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get it. Well, Joe, thank you so much for joining us here on this episode of WP Briefing. You have been a delight to chat with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Joe Devon 00:28:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, it&#8217;s really been a pleasure to meet you, and uh, and I appreciate the opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:28:54] </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our smallest of big things. As I mentioned at the start, it is packed. Number one tomorrow, May 17th, RC3. So one of the final RCs that we&#8217;re going to have for the WordPress 6.0 release, unless something goes horribly, horribly wrong, which I don&#8217;t think it will. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, two days after that, Global Accessibility Awareness Day, as I mentioned, will be on May 19th. So, this coming Thursday. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then next week, we have the 6.0 release. We have the WordPress 6.0 release on May 24th. </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Three days after that, WordPress turns 19 on May 27th, starting its final teenage year before we turn twenty in 2023. So that was the rapid-fire dance card for the next two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stuff that is happening with and around WordPress for everyone to know. As a heads up, also, many people are headed to WordCamp Europe in Porto(, Portugal). The first week of June, I am going to do a live from WordCamp Europe episode. It will not be live. I&#8217;ll just record it live. And so. You know you&#8217;ll get to hear me with my hoarsest voice and maybe singing to my computer.

Please do not install, run, and test this version of WordPress on a production or mission-critical website. Instead, it is recommended that you RC2 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test WordPress 6.0 RC2 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Option 1: </strong>Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Option 2: </strong>Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0-RC2.zip\">release candidate version here (zip)</a>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Option 3:</strong> When using WP-CLI to upgrade from Beta 1, 2, 3, 4, or RC1 on a case-insensitive filesystem, please use the following command:<br><code>wp core update --version=6.0-RC2</code></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-0/\">6.0 release cycle is available here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-0/\">6.0-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks, which will detail all upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Plugin and Theme Developers</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>All plugin and theme developers should test their respective extensions against WordPress 6.0 RC2 and update the “<em>Tested up to”</em> version in their readme file to 6.0. If you find compatibility problems, please be sure to post detailed information to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">support forums</a> so that these items can be investigated further prior to the final release date of May 24th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/03/wordpress-6-0-field-guide/\"><em>WordPress 6.0 Field Guide</em></a> for more details on this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Translate WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help translate WordPress into more than 100 languages</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>How to Help Test WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development. Testing is also a great way to contribute to WordPress. If you are new to testing, check out this <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2022/04/12/help-wanted-test-wordpress-6-0/\">detailed guide</a> that will walk you through how to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think you have run into an issue, please report it to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums.

Please do not install, run, and test this version of WordPress on a production or mission-critical website. Instead, it is recommended that you RC1 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test WordPress 6.0 RC1 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 1: </strong>Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 2: </strong>Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0-RC1.zip\">release candidate version here (zip)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> When using WP-CLI to upgrade from Beta 1, 2, 3, or 4, on a case-insensitive filesystem, please use the following command:<br><code>wp core update --version=6.0-RC1</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-0/\">6.0 release cycle is available here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-0/\">6.0-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks which will detail all upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>What’s in WordPress 6.0 RC1?</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Beta 4, various items have been addressed, including (but not limited to):&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Backport updates of Comment blocks tests (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55643\">#55643</a>)</li><li>Backport a bugfix of Comment Template block pagination (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55658\">#55658</a>)</li><li>Editor: Backport bug fixes for WordPress 6.0 from Gutenberg (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55567\">#55567</a>)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.0 is the second major release for 2022, following 5.9 which became generally available in January. This release includes nearly 1,000 fixes and enhancements spanning most areas of the WordPress platform. Some key highlights within the content creation and site-building feature sets include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Style Switching:</strong> <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/03/03/core-editor-improvement-choose-your-style/\">switch up the look and feel of your site</a>, all in one block theme. No need to change themes!</li><li><strong>More template options:</strong> use blocks to edit five more templates (author, date, categories, tag, and taxonomy).</li><li><strong>Multi-select: </strong>Easily select text across multiple blocks. Edit to your liking.</li><li><strong>Retain Styles: </strong>Keep your custom styles in place, whether transforming between blocks or creating new buttons.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>More patterns in more places:</strong> the Quick Inserter surfaces patterns that might work well for the condition you’re in, baking in relevant patterns for template parts and pages you’re working on.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>List View improvements: </strong>New keyboard shortcuts (shift + click) let you select multiple blocks to modify in bulk (reposition, delete, etc.), see your content at a glance with a collapsed by default view, and more.</li><li><strong>Refined design tools: </strong>Explore<strong> </strong>a new color panel, transparency options, more group block variations to create new layout options (Stack, Row), the ability to set your featured image in a Cover block, control the exact size of your featured image, gap support for the Gallery block, and more.</li><li><strong>New blocks: </strong>Various Post Comments, Read More, No Results in Query Loop, Post Author Biography, Avatar blocks.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Block Locking: </strong>Choose to disable the option to remove a block, move it, or both, right in the editor.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Export block themes: </strong>Explore the improved block theme export tool, as WordPress heads closer to codeless visual block theme building.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h1>Plugin and Theme Developers</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>All plugin and theme developers should test their respective extensions against WordPress 6.0 RC1 and update the “<em>Tested up to”</em> version in their readme file to 6.0. If you find compatibility problems, please be sure to post detailed information to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">support forums</a>, so these items can be investigated further prior to the final release date of May 24th.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review the <em><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/03/wordpress-6-0-field-guide/\">WordPress 6.0 Field Guide</a></em>, for more details on what’s contained in this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>Translate WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help translate WordPress into more than 100 languages.</a> This release also marks the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/glossary/#hard-freeze\">hard string freeze</a> point of the 6.0 release cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1>How to Help Test WordPress</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:00:40]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tomorrow&#8217;s a big day. It marks the beginning of what is called the RC period, or release candidate period, for the current major release of the WordPress CMS. If you&#8217;re not super familiar with the way release cycles work, this is the point in the process where the code should pretty much be done changing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That way you can call in your designers, developers, and anyone else who builds things for others using your software. And they can either start testing their products on it, or they can figure out what new things they need to be able to teach their clients, whichever is most relevant to them. That is generally true for WordPress as well, but in true open source fashion, there is a caveat built in that helps us to get in last-minute, vital changes from contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a two-person sign-off rule that&#8217;s been around for about as long as I can remember, but lets things be added late in the release cycle, as long as there are two sign-offs from qualified contributors. Most of the time, those qualified contributors are lead developers of the project, but not always. We have a good group of people who are around helping us make sure that this is doable and the best thing that we can offer to all of our users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:50]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, yeah, two-person sign-off, that is the little bit of release process trivia that you never knew you needed. And since we&#8217;re looking at a release trivia, kind of hidden bits of how software is made, I actually have a guest with me today, Channing Ritter. So Channing is a product and visual designer based in Brooklyn, New York.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#8217;s a design director at Automattic and has been working on the WordPress project as a full-time sponsored contributor since January, 2021. She is joining us to share some behind the scenes intel on what&#8217;s going into the 6.0 release, her role in that process, and then we&#8217;ll just kind of see how the conversation goes from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:40]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, and with that, I&#8217;d like to welcome Channing to the WordPress Briefing. Hi Channing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter </strong>00:02:45]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey Josepha. Thanks so much for having me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:02:48] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m excited to have you here. If I understand, you are working on the design side of things with the release. So why don&#8217;t you tell me a little bit about the role you&#8217;ve played?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:02:59] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am. I am the design release lead for the 6.0 release. And if I understand correctly, this is a position that has been unfulfilled for the past few release cycles. So I&#8217;m kind of the first person to step in over the past few releases. And I think that&#8217;s really exciting, especially because design has started to play such a more important role in the WordPress project over the past few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it makes sense that design would have a seat at the table, and I&#8217;m really excited to be helping advocate for the design team and learning from other folks on the release squad. Who&#8217;ve been doing this for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:03:33] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. First big question about 6.0, what is the feature that you are most excited about?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:03:39] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m most excited about the style switcher within the global styles panel. Um, so if folks still don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about there, it&#8217;s the ability to change between different variations of the theme.json without actually switching the theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is a way to get a drastically different look and feels across your site with just a single click. And I see it as a really fun place to experiment and kind of get inspired for the different ways your site could appear without ever having to change your theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in terms of the Twenty Twenty-Two variations, they&#8217;re just really gorgeous and all so diverse. Like you have the main default theme that has the deep green and kind of peachy colors and this really elegant type treatment with a really thin Serif typeface. But then the variations are so different from that. And I think my favorite one is the Swiss variation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:04:36]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Swiss variation?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:04:38]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, every graphic design nerd loves Swiss design.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:04:42] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, ok! Now I know!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:04:38] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Really awesome things found in there. It&#8217;s a really high contrast, bold variation. It&#8217;s kind of black and white with red accents. I just love how different it is from the default style and how easy it is to change up your site and just get a whole drastically different look and feel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:05:00] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s excellent. So for folks who do not know what we&#8217;re referring to, when we talk about the Twenty Twenty-Two variation, that is the default theme, Twenty Twenty-Two. I&#8217;ll put a link to both the classic and block-based versions in our show notes, but you&#8217;ll want to use the block-based version to look at these style variations that Channing has mentioned here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:05:24] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we&#8217;re really excited that the first-ever default block theme was released with 5.9, which is when Twenty Twenty-Two first went out and was bundled with 5.9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, with 6.0, I think even more so it&#8217;s starting to showcase the real power of block themes and what can actually be done there. And style variations is a huge kind of first step into this new world of block themes and starting to really open up the possibilities and all the flexibility that you have there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:05:55] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, absolutely. So when we&#8217;re talking about the Twenty Twenty-Two default theme, when we&#8217;re talking about switching these variations inside the theme itself, that seems to me to be a very user-focused kind of feature. And when we talk about users in WordPress, there&#8217;s a lot of room for interpretation. Like if we look at it kind of in a framework of three types of users of WordPress, you have, like end-users. So people who are site owners using it as a site to, like, enable their business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you also have mid-end users—people who use it to build sites for others. And what I like to call back-end users, people who are using WordPress as a framework. And of course at the start of the Gutenberg project, way back in forever, a million years ago, one of the big calls to action that we had around even, like, trying to do this, was that we wanted to make WordPress easier for users. Just plain users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and to me, that means making WordPress easier for those mid-end users, people who are creating WordPress sites for other people. But also should give some power and autonomy back to those end-users, the people who are using sites to enable their business or are site owners.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:07:14] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so in that context, between 5.9 and 6.0, do you feel like we have features that are really giving that kind of power and agency back to our end-users? Do you feel like we have some features that are really focused on those mid-end users, as opposed to our backend users? For a long time, we focused heavily on enabling our backend users, and now Gutenberg kind of moves us into those other two areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so do you think that things like being able to switch between your style of variations, other things like that are moving us closer to that particular goal of Gutenberg?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:07:51] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a great question. I think it&#8217;s both. I think some of the features being released in 6.0 are absolutely going to empower that end-user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Particularly in terms of improvements around design tools and some of the quality of life improvements. For example, partially selecting across multiple blocks and being able to partially select texts there. That&#8217;s the type of thing that really brings the writing experience in the editor to be on par with how you would expect a text editing experience to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are tons of small quality of life improvements in this release that I think are really gonna help those end-users. But there are also improvements around what we might call the maintainers who are building sites for others. I think block locking in particular is something that is really going to start filling a gap between people who build the sites and then people who do the day-to-day maintenance within a site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in 6.0, we&#8217;re introducing some interface UI around block locking, but also there&#8217;ll be control around the ability to lock user roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:09:03]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which I think makes a lot of sense. I mean, we have all of these user roles in the CMS itself, and for a long time, we&#8217;ve just been like free for all on blocks, which was great and is great and should be available to people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also if we are saying, like, it makes sense to have this gradient of users and their abilities for the CMS itself, and we are saying that we want to move control of the website and the content to be at the base layer in these blocks, then it also makes sense that we should be able to provide that same sort of granular level of access in the blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that&#8217;s a great thing. If you all, if dear listeners, you do not know what we mean by “block locking,” I&#8217;m sure that I can find a link for us in our show notes below as well. If for anyone who&#8217;s been talking through Gutenberg things with me for a while, you know that this is one of the primary use cases that I think has been a long time coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:10:05]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was one of the first examples that I offered to folks when we had that question of like, who is this being built for? In what way is this beneficial to that mid-end user, as opposed to just giving all of the power and autonomy to users in a way that maybe is not the best for their visitors?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of those use cases that made the most sense to me being able to say, okay, well, the opportunity to, as somebody who runs an agency and is building websites for people to be able to say, yeah, ‘You can do anything that is possible in this instance of WordPress and all the things that you are allowed to do will not break your instance. It won&#8217;t break your website’.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it gives a lot of time back to agencies to focus on their client&#8217;s most important problems, as opposed to not knowing how to update the hours in their footer or something like that. And so I&#8217;m very excited about that particular feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:11:01]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s such a long-requested feature. I mean, we&#8217;ve been hearing requests around this particular feature for years and, you know, often when something gets requested over a span of years like that, it&#8217;s because there are some complexities to figure out how it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s definitely been the case with moving forward with block locking. And there are a lot of nuances there. But I think what you were saying, I totally agree with. There’s always a push and pull. And as we enable more and more flexibility for end-users, there needs to be a little bit of push from the other side to kind of give more granular controls, more locking options, and make sure that everything can still be easily maintained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:11:43]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, we mentioned in that answer the concept of maintainers. If you are a contributor, it&#8217;s not <em>that</em> kind of ‘maintainer.’ So if you&#8217;re a WordPress contributor and we said maintainers there, um, just know that that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re referring to. If you don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about when I say ‘contributor,’ there is a whole community of open source people and maintainers are people who specifically take care of a particular part of the WordPress software or the WordPress project, um, that makes all this possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s, ya know….&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:12:19] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So true! The maintainer has another meaning in this context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:12:20]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, we have a mix in our audience and I love it, but it also makes me frequently spend like 10% of my podcast being like, by the way, when I said this, I didn&#8217;t mean you, but I did mean <em>you</em>, which makes it harder. I know.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So. You’ve been with the project for a little bit, but if I recall correctly, this is the first time that you were, like, leading part of a release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what would you say was the most challenging part of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong>  00:12:52] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great question. This is my first time being this closely involved with the release. Although I was involved with the 5.9 release, but mostly in a release assets capacity. So I helped with the <em>About Page</em> and the welcome banner that goes on the dashboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I did get some insight in the last release cycle. Which was great preparation for being more involved as a release lead on this cycle. From the design perspective, one of the hardest things is always going to be figuring out what exactly goes into the release and what needs more time. In the sense, you know, that there might be some features that need to stay in the Gutenberg plugin for a while and get more testing before they get released to a much wider audience in a major WordPress release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think on the design side, we definitely have some goals that are big, long-term projects that are likely going to span across, you know, many releases, maybe even over many years. And I think the full site editor is a great example of that in a sense that it&#8217;s not something that you just were gone in one release and then it all gets released and then it&#8217;s all good to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong>  00:14:06] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s something that has to be staggered across many releases, and there&#8217;s a lot of thought that goes into it; does this make sense in this more limited capacity, and what else needs to go in in order for this feature to go in? And the most complex things about the WordPress project is how interconnected things are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you start making those decisions about what should go in, what should get pulled out, often there&#8217;s sort of a domino effect of like, well, that would affect this feature and then, well, maybe they shouldn&#8217;t go in, or maybe this does need to go in. And that is really one of the most challenging, but also one of the most fascinating aspects of the release process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:14:46] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. It is very, very true that there are kind of no small problems left in WordPress. *laughs* Yeah, when we, when we first started with this like bigger release squad, cause that has not been routine for the history of the project. When we first started with that, I know that expanding out the exposure to like how much one change affects 25 different things was really, it was really good for all of us to be reminded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I mentioned at the top of our episode today, tomorrow begins the RC period. It begins the release candidate period, which is when it&#8217;s supposed to be, as locked down as possible. But if you all have been following along with our release process in general, which if you&#8217;re listening to this, you probably have, you know that last week or a couple of weeks ago, we had this whole question about the Webfonts API, and we had that conversation in a public space as best we could,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, there are always things that you can&#8217;t, like, fully disclose in public spaces, but we had a very open and transparent conversation about, like, who is most affected by putting it in, in the state that the API was in. And, who&#8217;s most affected if we take it out. And where can we make compromises on either side so that both sides are a little happy and a little unhappy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:16:09] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, like, that is all so hard to do. Not only in general. We have a 20-year-old code base and a five-year-old code base. And it&#8217;s all a big, big undertaking to understand what is happening and where it happens. And so there&#8217;s this moment always when we are trying to decide, like, is this baked enough? Did we put it in too early? Should we pull it out? How, if we pull it out, did we ask people to do too much work before we decided to pull it out anyway?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, you always have those kinds of questions about it. And honestly, I think that most of us weren&#8217;t around the last time, that WordPress was, was this experimental in public, like it&#8217;s always been open source. It&#8217;s always been experimental and iterating publicly, which is just the hardest way to work on anything. We like, we shipped our best guesses. Don&#8217;t be mad. It&#8217;ll be… we&#8217;re coming for it. We&#8217;re going to fix it. Like, that&#8217;s always hard, but the last time around, when it was this substantial a change was, like, 2008 or something, like, it was ages and ages ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong>  00:17:14] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we were smaller than, we had a smaller number of contributors. We had a smaller group of people actually using the CMS. And so over time it has gotten more and more complicated. And, and I don&#8217;t think that we can ever understate the complexities of that. And so for you, you had a little bit of exposure to it in 5.9 and then showed up for like really doing it in 6.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Has it been a surprising change? Like, were you surprised much more by how complicated it was when you were closer to it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:17:47] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, definitely. It’s been a real learning process, especially coming to understand how much there really are no easy answers. I think a lot of us are in the release squad are real problem solver types of people and, and want it to, you know, be a really neat, tidy answer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s not always the case. You know, sometimes parts of the feature might go in, or some contingency plan might get put into place and things didn&#8217;t go exactly as planned. But what you said of being an experiment and being on kind of the cutting edge of trying out new things, I think there is a lot of passion around that in the WordPress project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, we&#8217;re in such a transitional period for the project, you know, moving from classic themes to block themes and really changing the ideas of how we approach designing sites. And because of that, I think there is a lot of momentum and energy around getting new features, as many new features as possible into each release. But there&#8217;s also, you know, a lot of testing and stuff that needs to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to make sure that, like you said, these things aren&#8217;t going out too early.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:19:01] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, and there&#8217;s always that difficulty, we&#8217;re going to just leap right into open source areas now. There&#8217;s always that difficulty around, like, there&#8217;s this concept that when, like, we always want to ship something that doesn&#8217;t break backward compatibility when possible, we don&#8217;t want to ship vulnerabilities. Like, that&#8217;s always true, but we are in an open source project, and open source projects are necessarily kind of tolerant of like, that&#8217;s not our best, but like it skates, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was, we aimed for Ferrari and got a skateboard because sometimes you got to start with a skateboard, right? *laughter* Like if it gets you from one place to another, that&#8217;s kind of where we&#8217;ve got to aim some days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:19:45] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Totally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong>  00:19:46] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s always so, so difficult, especially cause, like, for the big change that 5.0 represented, and that 5.9 represented– 6.0 is not as big a shock as 5.9 was.&nbsp; But, like, as big a change as those represented, it still skates. And that&#8217;s, I think what makes the work especially hard, especially nuanced. And like, we haven&#8217;t gotten together as human beings in two years. And so sometimes people just kind of forget there&#8217;s a human being back there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re humans. Everyone be nice. Yeah. I don&#8217;t know that part of running a release definitely was surprising to me. My first release that I ran was 5.0 and…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:20:31] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, wow!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:20:32]</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Yeah, it was, like, that was  2018. And then I became the executive director at the top of 2019. And I distinctly remember one core chat where I showed up and just was like the most transparent, vulnerable person we&#8217;ve ever experienced in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not true. We have very vulnerable people in the project and very transparent people, but I told everyone like, there are a million of you and one of me, and it&#8217;s kind of terrifying that you&#8217;re leaping on me in this—like you&#8217;re scaring me a lot right now. And that was quite a thing to say to like, all these… it&#8217;s terrifying! Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:21:12] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love when you see that type of vulnerability in the project. I think it takes… it takes a degree of comfort and familiarity with the project to even be able to admit to that. And to me, that&#8217;s a real sign of growth in the project. Like when I first started contributing, I don&#8217;t think I ever would have just said, like, ‘How is the feature supposed to work? I have no idea.’ That&#8217;s something that I say all the time now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>*Laughter*</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know, that is completely fine and more than okay. It&#8217;s a massive project. There are folks who have done deep thinking about a feature over the course of years. You know, and there are experts who can help shed light on various problems that maybe you just haven&#8217;t had a chance to dive into yet and really understand the nuances of yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the amazing thing about open source is that you can lean on folks who do have expertise in that particular area. You&#8217;re not expected to be an expert-expert in every single domain. It&#8217;s okay to say, I don&#8217;t really have a good idea or a good concept of this feature. I don&#8217;t have a good feeling for it. What do other folks think?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:22:24] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And even people who have been in the project for a long time, decade plus, still say that all the time. You know, or you might just say, like, I have a really rough idea of how this works, are other people seeing this the same way? Or did other people have a different, you know, mental picture of how this might work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if, sometimes it feels like you&#8217;re over-communicating, it&#8217;s really helpful because often people do have really dramatically different ideas about how a feature might take shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:22:49] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I hope that&#8217;s one of the things that we never lose in the project. Like we are an old, old project now and we support a bunch of the web with a tiny, tiny group of people compared to the amount of the web that we support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I hope that we always have that opportunity as senior leaders, which I am, and all of our upcoming leaders to all of us, just at some point, be like, can we stop the train? I don&#8217;t understand. I don’t understand that. Um, and not necessarily feel that that has made us a worse contributor. Cause I think that it&#8217;s when we are transparent about our lack of understanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s when we have the opportunity to make what we&#8217;re offering to the world more solid and always better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:23:35] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love it. I think it&#8217;s the, one of the most lovely things about the WordPress community. There&#8217;s really low judgment around those types of questions and people are really inclusive and more than happy to take a moment to explain something to you or shed some light on an issue you might not have thought that much about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s one of the best things you can always reach out for help. And folks are always willing to provide guidance or context or even historical information about, you know, whether it&#8217;s been tried in the past or previous explorations and that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:24:10] </p>\n\n\n\n<p> All right. Well, that covers all of my questions for you. Do you have a final thought about the release that you would like to share with everyone you don&#8217;t have to, if you don&#8217;t want to, not everyone has like a final sign off.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:24:25] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. One of the things I&#8217;m most excited about for this 6.0 release is all of the improvements around design tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And these are just small improvements around a ton of different things, like the color panel, border controls, gap support, typography options, flexible container blocks, etc. These are the types of tools that are a designer&#8217;s dream. You know, they really make the difference between being able to make a really crisp, finished looking final product and having something that&#8217;s a little rough around the edges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a designer, like those are the things that your eye goes straight towards. And all of these nuanced new tools, they really allow designers to have that fine detailed control to create really pixel perfect sites. And I think that&#8217;s something that, you know, myself and a lot of others on the design team are just so beyond excited about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:25:25]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. Well, Channing, thank you so much for joining us today on the WordPress Briefing; it has been an absolute delight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Channing Ritter</strong> 00:25:32] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong> 00:25:41] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it is time, woohoo, for the small list of big things. My favorite part of this podcast, that&#8217;s not true. I have a lot of things that I love about this podcast. I just, in particular love being able to share like three things that are coming up in the next couple of weeks that everybody should be aware of. And I really particularly like the list I have this week.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First as of today, we are two weeks away from WordSesh. If you&#8217;re looking forward to your first in-person WordPress event, but feel like you could use a little foundation information, a little bit of a WordPress primer, then this event has a lot of excellent thought leaders in the project that you can learn from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for more practical or hands-on opportunities, uh, you can also check out social learning spaces. All of those are free for anyone. So I will include links to both of them in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:26:30]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, as of today, we are four weeks away from WordCamp Europe. This is one of our flagship events. So it also includes a contributor day, which I encourage you to look into. If you have never heard of one before. I will be there to meet some of the contributors that have joined the project since the end of 2019. And hopefully, I will see you there as well. If you&#8217;ve never heard of a contributor day, then I&#8217;ll include a link to the beginner&#8217;s guide to contributions, a little talk that I gave in 2017 in the show notes that should help you get your bearings or at the very least know what questions to ask yourself to figure out if a contributor day is right for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing as of today, it has been one week since <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/iandunn/\">Ian Dunn</a> and the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/\">Meta</a> developers… Um, that sounds like a band… Ian Dunn and the Meta developers connected the props channel in the community Slack to WordPress.org profile activity. I&#8217;m really excited about this. It&#8217;s the first in a long list of changes that are part of a larger project to credit more non-code contributions, more contributions that are not specific to a major release or event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also to set us up to be able to provide more quality checks and balances for our growing Five for the Future program. If you&#8217;ve not been over there lately, if you&#8217;re not super sure what I&#8217;m talking about, there&#8217;s a link to the discussion post that we had about it, but also you can wander right over into the Making WordPress Slack and check out the props channel to just kind of see a running list of contributors that people are really grateful for. Which, frankly, if you ever are having a bad day, that is a wonderful place to just kind of wander in and see all of the positive vibes that people are sending around to each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, yeah, so the props channel, is always good. Uh, and that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12742\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"People of WordPress: Meher Bala\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/04/people-of-wordpress-meher-bala/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 30 Apr 2022 09:20:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:7:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"HeroPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"People of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"WordCamp Mumbai\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:6;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"wptranslationday\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12706\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:106:\"This month\'s People of WordPress feature shares the story of developer and e-commerce builder Meher Bala. \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"webcommsat AbhaNonStopNewsUK\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16754:\"\n<p>In this series, we share some of the inspiring stories of how WordPress and its global network of contributors can change people’s lives for the better.

From using the software as a basic website tool to helping entrepreneurs and good causes around the world fulfill their aspirations, she has overcome personal barriers and now aims to inspire others.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher found her vocation and learned new skills through WordPress. She also discovered a way to encourage other women to consider careers in IT.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Opening the doors to a career in technology</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a child, Meher was diagnosed with dyslexia (difficulty in reading the written word) and dyscalculia (difficulty in comprehending numbers and mathematical functions). With the support of her parents and a tutor, she was able to overcome this learning obstacle. She developed coping techniques and a determination to work to overcome challenges as they appeared later in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In school, she got an opportunity to replace one subject with computer studies as an alternative. This proved to be an eye-opener to future career possibilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She began to research not only what the internet had to offer but also how it worked, including the new and fascinating concepts of email and websites. Her father bought the family’s first desktop computer so she could do her research at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher’s father wanted to turn her love for computers into something that would serve her well in the future. In 2005, he enrolled her in a short computer course from a global IT training provider. The course tutor was so impressed with her performance, she was advised to enroll in a four year software development course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That meant she had studied the software development course alongside her higher education college course. Looking back, she enjoyed the dual challenge of the degree course in commerce, and the experience prepared her well to keep learning software while working as a developer. Within three years, she had learned C#, C, C++, HTML, Java, and .NET. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After graduation, she was in a dilemma to choose between commerce and IT. What to choose? She had a compulsory one-year technology internship to complete, and her choice of focus for that year would prove to be a defining moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2009, on her birthday, Meher was offered an internship. On the first day of the internship, she was introduced to WordPress. Her initial assignment was to change the look and feel of the WordPress dashboard — in just six hours. But there was a problem &#8211; she had never worked with WordPress before!</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;I stared at the whiteboard and thought that task given was impossible and difficult to meet the deadline. I wondered if my boss was joking and did not know then what you could do with WordPress as a developer and how it could slot into your toolbox. It opened my eyes.&#8221;&nbsp;</p><cite>Meher Bala</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher used her research skills to know more about using WordPress. She found a plugin that would help her achieve her task. She met the deadline and it ingrained an interest that she would never lose. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Re-discovering WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Five years after her initial WordPress experience, Meher was assigned to lead an international project in WordPress.&nbsp;She was hesitant — she had lost touch with the CMS during that five years, but the project was a great opportunity to become a team leader and lead from the front.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She decided to update her WordPress skills, relying again on the strength of her research skills and determination. In the process, she also taught her team all about WordPress, inspiring many of those members to continue to develop their WordPress skill set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The success of that project was a pivotal moment for Meher and a new dawn as a developer specializing in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a team lead, Meher soon found it was not possible to always have all the answers straight away. She found internet searches gave practical solutions—but rarely explained the theory behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So she went looking for a WordPress group to help her expand the scope and depth of her knowledge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding the community and its developer learning opportunities </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"999\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=999%2C667&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher at WordCamp Nagpur in 2017\" class=\"wp-image-12762\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?w=999&amp;ssl=1 999w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/dsc_00345.jpg?resize=768%2C513&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Meher enjoying being part of <em>WordCamp Nagpur in 2017</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, while browsing Facebook, Meher came across an advertisement for something called WordCamp Mumbai, an event that had taken two days before. She did a little digging to learn what a WordCamp was, and about the people behind it. She took the plunge and joined the WordPress Mumbai Meetup group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her first Meetup experience was not love at first sight. She felt the topics were for advanced users, and the timing late in the evening made it difficult to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a few months later, the Meetup addressed a topic that could help her resolve an issue in one of her current projects. She made the effort to show up and came away with a number of important tips.&nbsp;The speaker had taken the time to speak to individual attendees. When he came to Meher, she took the opportunity to ask a couple of questions about her project issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thereafter she went to more Meetups and got to know the people behind this group, just as they started talking about WordCamp Mumbai 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A WordCamp adventure</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?resize=600%2C800&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher pictured with the WordCamp Mumbai 2016 sign \" class=\"wp-image-12758\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcm16.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Meher discovering <em>WordCamps in Mumbai in 2016</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher expressed interest in being a part of the coming&nbsp; WordCamp Mumbai and started in an entry-level role with basic responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, she thought WordCamp was a formal conference with about 100 people. So on the first day of WordCamp Mumbai 2016, she was surprised to see so many WordCamp enthusiasts attending and enjoying such a relaxed and friendly conference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that great experience, Meher went to many more meetups and did more volunteering. She started taking on responsibilities in the coming WordCamps and getting to know the different aspects of the camp.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the following years, at each WordPress, she took up a new role like speaker vetting, sponsors, and volunteer coordination. This allowed her to know more about what an organizer needs to do, from planning to execution, to make WordCamp a successful event.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=900%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WordCamp Mumbai 2017 group photo of the team\" class=\"wp-image-12765\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?w=900&amp;ssl=1 900w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wcmumbai-17.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>With the team at <em>WordCamp Mumbai in 2017</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher is grateful for her WordPress journey which was fostered in the Mumbai community. It has been filled with beautiful surprises.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people ask why she’s chosen to specialize professionally in WordPress, Meher says WordPress is easy to teach a non-technical person, yet it is still highly customizable. Being a WordPress developer has given her the opportunity to work&nbsp; remotely for global web development companies that let her think out of the box. And she learns new skills with every release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The community makes WordPress special</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher says that some of her most memorable WordPress moments have revolved around special friendships, trying new things, and participating in community building.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has let her explore different parts of India, make new friends locally and internationally, and encourage women to be a part of meetup groups and events across India.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Meher’s biggest dreams was to lead WordCamp Mumbai as a lead organizer and show others what could be achieved by working together in open source. In 2019, she did just that and has volunteered at international WordCamps and meetups since.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"515\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Meher speaking at WordCamp Mumbai 2019\" class=\"wp-image-12731\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=300%2C151&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?resize=768%2C386&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/04/wc-19.jpg?w=1247&amp;ssl=1 1247w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Taking to the stage at WordCamp Mumbai in 2019</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of her enthusiasm for sharing the opportunities WordPress can give people, especially women, she has given time to co-organize two global <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">WordPress Translation month long events</a> and contributor events in India.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher said: “I was first introduced to translation at one of the meetups which was organised to support the WordPress Translation Day. I realized this was another way to support my local communities and bring the power of WordPress to them by contributing in Gujarati and Hindi. I did not imagine I would a few years later be a global organizer for the event itself!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With her commitment to ongoing learning as a developer and to model what she believes about the value and community growth opportunities of open source, Meher has given time and energy to the Marketing Team, where she has been a Team Rep, to the Training Team, and to the Core Team contributing to multiple releases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The developer adventure with WordPress is unlimited</h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>At the start of my software developer journey, I always thought the C++ and Java were the only skills you required to excel in your career. From the time I started exploring WordPress in depth, I realized the potential and the power of WordPress in web development.</p><cite>Meher Bala</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Being a part of the WordPress community, Meher learned that there is so much more than just building blogs on WordPress. She started exploring different features of WordPress, created her first theme, and eventually specialized as a frontend specialist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher now works as a consultant and front end developer with an international agency specializing in WordPress. Asked what she thought was the best thing about being a WordPress developer, Meher replied: &#8220;Through WordPress, I have an opportunity to build unique out of the box websites and work&nbsp;remotely for global web development companies that encourages you to think out of the box. There is always opportunity to continuously advance my coding skills and learn new techniques with every release.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She believes that there is no limit to where using the software can take you and what you can combine it with to find solutions to projects big and small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you earn a living from WordPress, her advice is from the heart: try to give back to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I am sure you will learn or teach something new and definitely make friends across the world. There is no shame in making mistakes, as you can learn from them and develop your skills further. You can also help others as they build their skills.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meher added: “Don’t let the things you find difficult get in the way of your success.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"share-the-stories\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>), Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>), Mary Baum (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>), Chloé Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>), and Meg Phillips (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/megphillips91/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>megphillips91</a>) for interviews, writing and image work on this story.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing. The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:39] </strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So you&#8217;ve been listening to this podcast for a while. You may be one of these contributors I keep mentioning; you may be an agency owner or freelancer. Maybe you&#8217;ve wondered how to make a WordPress blog for your big idea. Or, maybe you&#8217;re one of the many people who use WordPress for their project or business. Before WordPress was known as a content management system, as a way to get sites online fast, it was a blogging tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have long since outgrown that, but even 19 years into our journey, blogging is still a key part of what WordPress enables you to do. That&#8217;s because even after those 19 years, the mission of WordPress is still the same. And that is to democratize publishing, to help people have a place online where they can tell their stories or share their projects or set up their businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve ever tried to set up a blog, you know that there isn&#8217;t a lot of information about what to know before you get going at all. So I&#8217;m going to talk about that a little bit today. And just by the way, if you heard the word blog right now and thought, oh, Josepha, how old fashioned? I think it&#8217;s important to remember that there&#8217;s a business advantage to having well-written, relevant content on your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re not blogging for business, because not all of us are, then the benefits are a little different but still important to my mind. Things like the cathartic benefits of journaling, a chance to build community, and the general importance of preserving wisdom for the ages. Anyway, back to the topic at hand. Before we can get to any of the fancy things that WordPress can do nowadays, it&#8217;s important to know a few things as you get ready to set up your first ever website.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s dive in. Here is how you need to get yourself started. First, have an idea and a plan. So have an idea for what you&#8217;re doing, the concept of your content, who you want to reach, and some concept of a domain name. I would encourage you to not necessarily get your heart set on a domain name at first. Cause, like, if you want the domain name, wordpress.org, like we own that, you can have that! But if you know that you want a domain like WordPressbloggingforthefuture.com, like that one might be more available. And if you know the kind of words you want in your domain, you can be a bit flexible about what is there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:09]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that you need to do is that if you are just getting started, ask yourself the question, what sort of host do I want? We kind of mentioned all along the WordPress process that, like, you need a good host, but it’s not always clear where that decision has to happen. It happens right here at the start, before you even know what WordPress is most of the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the earliest question that you have to answer for yourself is what sort of host do I want? Where do I want my site to live? So ask yourself how much you want to get into the maintenance and configuration of your website and the hardware that it lives on versus creating content or keeping your shop up to date.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this whole spectrum of hosting options, and they range from full service where they will keep your WordPress software up to date, provide daily backups, and have customer support if something goes really wrong. So it ranges all the way from full service like that all the way down to essentially zero services, just kind of hands-off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:11]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>They give you a space to keep your WordPress software, to keep your WordPress site. But they leave everything else up to you. They leave the backups up to you. They leave updating up to you, things like. So that&#8217;s the first thing you have to ask yourself. And the first question you have to be able to answer. Most of the time, you will want to start with one of the full-service options. That way, you know that your software is set up correctly and safely from the start. And as you learn more about the software and what you want and what you need, and you have the ability to learn in the time that you have, the more that you can add on either service with the existing hosts that you chose or moving to a different host; however that works out for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if that one sounds like the right option, then you choose a host, go to their site, and actually most of them will have a way to walk you through how to set up a WordPress site inside their system. Most of the time, it&#8217;s just one click and then they ask you some questions to get some configurations right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:10]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other option that on the like zero, zero service side, that&#8217;s not quite fair, but you know, the other side of that spectrum that probably will be appealing to you if you are already familiar with code or already know how to manage a server or, or you know how to work in this thing called c-panel, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you already have a lot of information on how all of that works, you can, if you want to, head over to wordpress.org/download, and you can download a zip file of the WordPress software and set that up in your own environment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, quick check here. If this all sounds roughly doable to you, or at least it feels like we&#8217;re in the right starting point, but you find yourself thinking, gosh, I just wish she would slow down a little.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got you covered. In the show notes, you&#8217;ll find a link to one of the Learn WP courses for getting started with WordPress. There&#8217;s a section on choosing a host as well as various other early steps of this process. So if you felt like I blazed through all of that, which honestly I kind of did, you can work through those lessons in that course, at your own pace, and it&#8217;s, and it&#8217;s really a very good guide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Let&#8217;s pretend we did all of that. Now you&#8217;ve got yourself a website. The thing that you will want to do next, or rather the first thing that you&#8217;ll notice once you get your site up and running, is that there&#8217;s this ‘Hello World’ post– there&#8217;s a post that already exists in there. The Hello World post is a placeholder for the common features of a blog post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There, you can find your featured image, your title, your content, and even some fake comments. You can either edit this post so that you can see how your writing will look from the start, and you can kind of compare like, okay, the Hello World part over here on this page, exists in this field over here on this page. So you can kind of see where everything works, how it all looks together. Or, if you&#8217;re more familiar with WordPress or CMS in general, you can simply remove that and start fresh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:07:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ve got now a website, we know, kind of, how to look at our posts and create posts, where comments are, where they can kind of be moderated and stuff. And so, the most fun task for everyone is choosing a theme. But if it&#8217;s not a fun task, if it doesn&#8217;t sound like a fun task to you, I can help you kind of do some, choose your own adventure guiding questions here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, you can ask yourself how you want the site to look. Do you want it to mostly be a lot of photos or entirely words, mostly animations? You can head to the theme directory and search for a theme with most of the features that you want. There&#8217;s like a filtering system where you can put in, like, you want three columns so that you can have three columns of text if you want it to look kind of like an old school newspaper kind of layout and things like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:08:12]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also a way to look for themes inside your instance, your WordPress site, but like, if you haven&#8217;t set that up yet, but you do still want to see kind of what your theme options are, you can go to wordpress.org/themes and and take a look at what&#8217;s out there. Just as a quick side note, if you get to that theme directory, if you get to wordpress.org/themes, and it feels overwhelming, which I can understand, I recommend starting with a theme that is designed for blogging specifically so that you can see how things look right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s actually a theme that does come with every WordPress site. So if you&#8217;re not ready, you can skip this thing entirely and just work with the theme that&#8217;s already there. Every word, press instance ships with a theme and it is fully functional when you, when you get your site up and running. So you don&#8217;t need to choose a theme right now if you don&#8217;t feel ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the other very fun thing that people do with their WordPress sites is to add plugins to them. So plugins are these little pieces of software that you add on to the WordPress software that lets it do additional things. It adds additional functionality. The questions that you can ask to kind of guide yourself through what sorts of plugins you might want, what sorts of functionality you might want to add to your site are a little similar to the ones that you want to ask for figuring out which theme.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:09:36]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So figure out if there are tasks that you need visitors to do. Do you need them to contact you? Do you want them to watch a video? Should they review and respond to questions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a concept of the things that you want users to do on your website, then you can head to the plugin directory and search for a plugin with features that you need. Also, there are just endless lists of recommended plugins out there; if that is something that you find valuable as part of your research, those are also easy to find.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a general side note here, there are even more plugins than there are themes. So if you have gotten to this point and feel like you don&#8217;t quite know the answers to the questions that I shared, and, and it&#8217;s going to be a while until you feel like you can know what those answers are. That&#8217;s totally fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll tell you this. I have never seen a site without a contact form. So feel free to begin your journey there. There are a lot of great plugins for contact forms and it can kind of help you figure out how to work with plugins in that way. So yeah, I made it sound like you can get a WordPress website built in like seven minutes and on the one hand you definitely can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:09:36]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on the other hand, it&#8217;s still a little bit more complicated. So here I have a final note for everyone. You will hear around the WordPress ecosystem. And obviously, here, are some things that could make you feel a little nervous about doing this for the first time. Things like the five-second installation, which WordPress has been famous for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also about how easy and simple it all is. And as somebody who was once in the position of learning WordPress for the first time, like I first encountered a WordPress site in 2009 and I started learning how to use WordPress in 2010. So I can say with confidence that once you learn it, it&#8217;s easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are the easiest of the hard options for CMS. Like content management systems are just complicated, but we are the easiest one out there. And so, as you&#8217;re learning, I want to just remind you to celebrate your small wins along the way. If you feel like you&#8217;re late to this blogging game, like you should have had a website for years. I mean, sure that could be true. And yes, the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. But the second-best time to plant that tree is today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress didn&#8217;t start out powering over 40% of the web, and your first site can&#8217;t be immediately measured in the millions of readers. So, what will your small beginning lead you to?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:12:25]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now that brings us to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one, the next release of WordPress, WordPress 6.0, has reached its beta phase. That means the full focus is on finding and fixing the bugs we accidentally created during this development cycle. Beta two comes out tomorrow and you can follow along in the core channel in the Making WordPress Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve never seen how those releases get packaged, and if you just want to keep an eye on what everybody&#8217;s doing so that you can be the first to know, yeah, Making WordPress Slack is the way to go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on our small list is that speaking of WordPress 6.0, we had the public walk through a couple of weeks ago, which means that in a few weeks, I&#8217;ll do a WordPress 6.0 sneak peek. I&#8217;ll share some highlights of the release features and why I think they are super important for you to take a look. Sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:13:22]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final, big thing, if you are new to WordPress and this episode has you all fired up to start your blog, we have a bunch of contributors over on the Learn WP team that have just the thing for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can join the online social learning space called How to Make a WordPress Blog. It&#8217;s a free online event that will help you get started. I&#8217;ll link the information in the show notes below. And I&#8217;ll also share in the show notes, a list of WordPress Meetup groups, where you can find more opportunities to learn and get support from other people locally who are also doing things with WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you can also find a list in the dashboard of your newly installed WordPress blog you no doubt have after this podcast.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12658\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"WordPress 6.0 Beta 1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/04/wordpress-6-0-beta-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 19:08:59 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12644\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WordPress 6.0 Beta 1 is now available for download and testing.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Dan Soschin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7809:\"\n<p>WordPress 6.0 Beta 1 is now available for download and testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development</strong>. Please do not install, run, and test this version of WordPress on a production or mission-critical website. Instead, it is recommended that you test Beta 1 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test the WordPress 6.0 Beta 1 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Option 1: Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</li><li>Option 2: Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.0-beta1.zip\">beta version here (zip)</a>.</li><li>Option 3: Use WP-CLI to test: <code>wp core update --version=6.0-beta1</code>. <br><strong><em>Do not use this option if your filesystem is case-insensitive.</em></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The current target for the final release is May 24, 2022, which is about six weeks away.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-0/\">6.0 release cycle is available</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-0/\">6.0-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks which will detail all upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Keep WordPress Bug Free – Help with Testing</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development. Testing is also a great way to contribute. If you have never tested a beta release before, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2022/04/12/help-wanted-test-wordpress-6-0/\">this detailed guide</a> will walk you through how to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing helps make sure that this and future releases of WordPress are as stable and issue-free as possible. And anyone can do it – especially great WordPress community members just like you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to know more about testing releases like this one? Read about the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/\">testing initiatives</a> that happen in Make Core. You can also join a <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/core-test/\">publicly-accessible channel</a> on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com\">Making WordPress Slack workspace</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think you have run into an issue, please report it to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums. If you are comfortable writing a reproducible bug report, you can <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/newticket\">file one on WordPress Trac</a>.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing: the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was checking the list of upcoming events recently as part of just my regular work and saw that the call for organizers for WordCamp Asia is open. On the one hand, it made my heart skip a beat with excitement. That event is six years or so in the making. And on the other hand, it reminded me of February 10th, 2020, the day that Matt told me that we had to proactively cancel WordCamp Asia. That week was truly heartbreaking for me as well as I think the entire organizing team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it also, fortunately, was prescient. As I think back over the two years since then, I&#8217;m grateful for our community wranglers and deputies who have consistently hosted important discussions about how to return to in-person events safely. And with two of our major flagship events returning this year, I&#8217;m here to summarize, sort of, what the rules and guidelines are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But certainly I hope that you come away from this with an idea of what&#8217;s being done to keep everyone safe as we are best able.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:44]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, before we dig into specifics, I want to be clear upfront that the guidelines for COVID-aware events are mandatory, unless otherwise stated. For folks who&#8217;ve been attending WordPress events, or participating in the community for a long time, this is a change. As a program, we have always done our best to be flexible with guidelines so that we can prioritize local knowledge. But our responsibility is to the long-term success of this community and this program. So moving forward with in-person events that risk the health of our community members poses risks to the program itself. So with that in mind, let&#8217;s learn what we&#8217;re going to see at events for the rest of the.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For any WordPress event that is gathering more than 50 people, the new mandatory guidelines are:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Number one, follow local laws and guidelines. If your area has suggested guidelines on top of the mandatory ones, follow those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, is if you are in a location where laws or guidelines require or permit venues to limit admission based on a person&#8217;s vaccination status and masking, then events can only happen in venues that are willing to provide staff to check for vaccination status at the door. And then also to remind participants to wear masks during the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing is if your area or venue legally cannot check vaccination status, your area must pass the in-person checklist, which I will link in the show notes below. But that in-person checklist has to be passed at the time of the application and then again at the time of the event. And in addition to that, the venue must be willing to provide staff who will remind participants to wear masks and check for temperature during the event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organizers in these areas must be prepared to move online or cancel if the region fails the safety checklist, which again, will be linked in the show notes below. So those are the three things and they are pretty dense, but also I think allow for a fair amount of flexibility. There is also a tidy flow chart linked in the sidebar of make.wordpress.org/community that will help you to decide what sort of event your own area can support right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those are the mandatory guidelines for WordPress events in general right now, but you probably also have a few specific questions. So I&#8217;ve got the three most common questions ready to go with answers from Angela Jin who helped me to kind of pull together the information for this particular podcast props to Angela. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:25]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, first question, anything specific to know about WordCamp Europe? WordCamp Europe will be following these guidelines as well. All attendees and participants are expected to wear a mask while they are at the event and catering will be offered outside so people can remove their masks to eat.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second common question is how will these guidelines change as countries and local governments begin deescalating restrictions and safety measures? We should consider these guidelines to be subject to evolution based on what the team is hearing and seeing from the community. But right now we intend to keep these stricter guidelines in place until we see how the loosened rules play out elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then a third frequent question is what&#8217;s going to happen to all these online events?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community team will continue to support online events right now. So if your community doesn&#8217;t feel ready to have an in-person event, but still wants to kind of get everyone together that is still allowed, and still&nbsp; encouraged. And finally the community team will continue to keep a close eye on situations around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it becomes safe to do so, and your community is interested, they of course will be happy to chat with you about a WordCamp. There is an application that I will share the link to in the show notes below as well. In case that is something that your community is wanting to look into.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and I have a little postscript also. I know I was like finally, and now I&#8217;m doing a finally, finally. That&#8217;s what postscripts are about. P.S. If you have not stopped by the community team’s site or any of their meetings, they&#8217;ve been doing a really great job of keeping things moving through two years of unpredictable changes. If you are a community team member, I want to offer you a huge thanks. Thank you so much for helping us to stay aware and able to move forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are an organizer, pat yourself on the back. I want to thank you for pivoting with us, moving through online events, even though they are not at all the same as in-person events and certainly they don&#8217;t share the reasons that we get people together sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, if you are an end to end attendee, if you go to WordPress meetups or you go to any sort of WordPress online events or WordCamps, anything like that, thank your local organizer. They have been doing this probably for a while, and I&#8217;m sure that they are looking forward to getting back to in-person events themselves, but even, so they have been putting in a lot of volunteer hours to help make sure that we all know how to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so find them, thank them, and I&#8217;m sure that they&#8217;ll appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:07:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, it is time for our small list of big things. Number one, WordCamp Asia has a call for organizers open! This event will be in 2023. And I think that we all simply cannot wait. So I&#8217;ll link the call for organizers in the show notes. And then of course you can follow that whole site to stay up to date on what&#8217;s happening there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is, while we&#8217;re on the topic of events, there&#8217;s also an open discussion about how we can best support organizers who are getting back to in-person events. We&#8217;d like thoughts from both organizers and attendees. So feel free to drop by and leave a note in the comments section. And while you&#8217;re over there, the third thing in my small list of big things, there&#8217;s also an open discussion about regional events. So go over there, get all your thoughts about WordPress events together. Get them all sorted out in one go. Just leave comments, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. All over the place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:08:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my most embarrassing WordCamp story actually has to do with where I was supposed to be versus where people thought I was supposed to be. This was early on in my time with WordPress, with Automattic. And I had convinced someone, I had convinced a colleague and friend of mine to go to my home WordCamp, WordCamp Fayetteville over there in Arkansas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I didn&#8217;t go. But I knew I wasn&#8217;t going, I knew I was going to WordCamp Boston, but he did not know that I was not going to go. And so he arrived at WordCamp Fayetteville, WordCamp Northwest Arkansas. I can&#8217;t remember what it was called at the time. And immediately was confused about where I was and why I wasn&#8217;t there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there was this excellent moment of mass confusion among states where the folks at WordCamp Fayetteville started tweeting about how I had convinced this contributor to go to that event and then didn&#8217;t show up. And then the folks at WordCamp Boston, we&#8217;re looking at all of those tweets, because if you are a WordCamp organizer, you are always looking at the tweets from all the other WordCamps happening in your weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And people got very confused about why I was in Boston while they were thinking that I was in Fayetteville, even though the tweets were talking about how, like, I wasn&#8217;t in Fayetteville. They probably didn&#8217;t say that it was probably more along the lines of like, “Hey, let&#8217;s share a photo with Josepha” to, like, make fun of the fact that I wasn&#8217;t there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I caused mass confusion in multiple states.

For Juan Aldasoro, a developer and product manager for a large distributed company, it provides an opportunity to combine his different interests and skills to live the type of life he wanted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I like visual, creative and technical things. The joy of WordPress is that you can do all of these things, you don’t have to limit yourself to any one aspect . You can also do this from almost anywhere in the world!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From working in products since 2012, Juan sees WordPress as a major part of his skillset and toolbox. He said: “It gives you an opportunity to be part of building a product which could potentially be used by thousands of people and more on your site. It encourages you to think about different languages and how you can make it accessible. It allows you to work on different platforms. Working in WordPress gives you this broad approach. Working this way on products ended up pushing me into learning about all these different things. Only in open source can you really do this and use your creative side to find solutions.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Learning about being part of a community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"924\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813.jpeg?resize=1024%2C924&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan standing in a astreet with murals behind him\" class=\"wp-image-12529\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=1024%2C924&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=300%2C271&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C693&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1386&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_2813-scaled.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1847&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Born in a mid-sized city in Argentina, Juan was raised in a family in which music, arts and sports were always an essential part of everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These activities encourage human beings to be creative and participative, and at the same time they are highly formative when it comes to mould people in order to become part of a group, a team, a community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The youngest of five siblings, Juan became highly motivated, trying to follow the steps of his siblings. Having a computer at home, he started to make connections that laid the foundation for his career as a developer. His interest in computers grew through that access to a machine running MS-DOS &#8211; the one with the black screen command line! Mastering this became a challenge to him and something to share with others. Through doing this, he found a way to more social interaction and new friendships.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Without being conscious of it, my friends and I were sharing pieces of code.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “I started learning some super easy stuff that made me feel like Houdini at that time. I could save a game play, something intangible, on a floppy disk and carry that piece of plastic and magnetic material back home. I was saving the play or game in a square object and then loading that back at home. I now realize, those were my first interactions with computer commands. Without being conscious of it, my friends and I were sharing pieces of code in a unique way.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This interest grew further through computer magazines and experimenting as &#8220;there was always something new to learn.” Although sport became a big part of Juan’s life in his teens, he kept up his computer learning. Taking a new direction, he found online tutorials enabling him to learn how to play the guitar. This led to setting up a punk rock band with his friends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Education has always been important in my family, and thanks to my parent’s efforts, I attended a school where I learned to express myself in another language.” The school had hired a satellite internet connection in the mid-nineties and had HTML on the computer studies program. These facilities were not that common in Argentina or many other countries either at that time. Also, his parents had the foresight to secure a rare internet connection at the house in 1997. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan recalled: “Browsing around the Internet opened a new universe in my mind. This new universe was extremely fantastic but also extremely expensive. I needed to make the most of every second online.”<br><br>“It was a whole new world and one thing led to the other. I started learning a bit of everything, editing graphics, scripting and so on. I still remember my first website in the fantastic sunset strip, Geocities.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Trying to go pro</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After high school, Juan moved to the city along with his brother and began to study IT at University. When he was asked by a friend to work at a software company, he decided to try that whilst continuing his studies. Through his job he had the chance to explore web-related opportunities, and with a friend from university, they started managing teams and projects across Latin America and Spain.<br><br>Juan describes this experience as one of the most fulfilling in his life. He was able to travel abroad for work, experience remote working, manage teams, present projects and speak formally in front of senior people. As the company grew at a fast pace, they learned how to set up and run a large organization. Eventually, he decided to drop out of his university program and focus on the opportunity of learning first hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=600%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan riding a bicycle in a historical city during his travels\" class=\"wp-image-12509\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/juanfra.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the key early learning from working internationally was that business and web development could be just as fast-moving and successful in Argentina as in other places. “I realized there’s no such thing as a secret sauce for success. Projects are backed by people’s talent and time, and you can find that in any latitude.”<br><br>By his mid-20s, Juan decided he wanted to try building something from scratch. He created a social network for photo sharing in Latin America, which was used by more than 30,000 people across Latin America and Spain in its time. Through this, he discovered that other people had a blog and he did not want to be left behind. The discovery of WordPress was to change the focus of his life.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hello to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spending some time traveling around Europe, Juan found himself ‘surrounded by uncertainty’ and worried about what the future could bring. “I had some clues, but under uncertainty, the more you ask the less you answer. I started thinking about embracing the following philosophy: I didn’t want to be part of a large company, I didn’t want to continue studying and I wanted to travel as much as I could.” He did not realize at that time how this vision for his life was to mirror what he would find in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He started using WordPress for a few sites in 2005. By 2007 he was using it for almost everything. He was struck by the magnitude and range of what the software could do, from a simple tool used to create a blog in the blink of an eye through to complex projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His first problem-solving project was simple and saved data received through a contact form plugin. “To complete this project I discovered the Codex and I learned how easy and intuitive it is to create a plugin. I had fallen in love with WordPress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I was truly amazed by how I could learn from others.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As he explored the options with the software, Juan was unsure of how intellectual property worked and wanted to be respectful of other people’s work. “I didn’t understand open source yet, and I wasn’t sure if I was stealing from others. That was my first interaction with GPL and open source. I was truly amazed by how I could learn from others and improve things created by others or by myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He realized: “WordPress was the way to go if I wanted to pursue a dream of traveling, skipping winter, and working at the same time; what we now call a digital nomad. I already knew how to work remotely, I could work for companies located anywhere, as long as they could communicate in English or Spanish.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan started his own web agency, where he provided services to small and medium-sized companies abroad in the USA, UK, and Australia. He built his reputation and developed strong relationships in WordPress. “The experience couldn’t be better. I was learning, having fun, making a living out of it, and at the same time exploring the world.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In mid-2012, he discovered the full power of the WordPress community firsthand. In his spare time he started developing themes and from all he heard, wanted to attend a major event with lots of others in WordPress, a WordCamp. He took the plunge and booked for WordCamp in Edinburgh, in the UK. He said: “I got to meet many super talented people, and the atmosphere of the event was awesome. A place where competitors were also colleagues. Seeing the humility of somebody like Mike Little, the co-founder of WordPress, was amazing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “While there, unconsciously, I started dreaming of holding something like that in Argentina &#8211; the joy of hosting the WordPress community in my home country.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back home, while browsing the Codex, he happened to see that WordPress was turning 10. A lot of meetups were going to be organized worldwide to celebrate the birthday. But there was nothing organized in Argentina. This was a catalyst for starting a local meetup. Together with a colleague, he&nbsp; organized an Argentinian 10th birthday meetup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than 20 people showed up. “There was a common denominator. We all loved WordPress, it was part of our day-to-day life. We wanted to share experiences, make new friends and continue growing from what we could learn from others. That day we were a group of people with shared interests. That’s the simplest way to define a community, isn’t it?” This early meetup led to the formation of what is now called <a href=\"http://wpargentina.org/\">WordPress Argentina</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his desire to skip winters and do more traveling, his next adventure was to take him to visit family working in the US and attend one of the biggest WordCamps in the world in San Francisco. His interest kept growing and he traveled across Europe to be part of the first edition of WordCamp Europe in the Netherlands in 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “There’s almost nothing I could write to fully express what you experience in such events. They are the main WordPress events worldwide. The best part: I made a lot of good friends from many different places. I’m glad I have more excuses to continue traveling.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again in Argentina, our organization started growing thanks to the energy of the whole group, we started hosting formal meetups. In May 2015, we crowned all these efforts with a new <a href=\"https://buenosaires.wordcamp.org/2015/\">WordCamp in Buenos Aires</a>, Argentina.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan speaking at WordCamp Buenos Aires\" class=\"wp-image-12528\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra-WCBA15-51-scaled.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Organizing such an event in my home country with many of the contributors I had met from the very first meetup was an experience I will always keep with me.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Juan believes one of his biggest contributions to open source was as part of being able to expand the community in Argentina and to share this with other Latin American and Spanish speaking countries. He also contributes as a volunteer translator in the Polyglots Team, to the Make WordPress Support team, and contributes to code blocks and Gutenberg. “I am really excited about seeing the future of Gutenberg as it is the future of WordPress.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout his time contributing, Juan believes in helping to set the foundations and encouraging others to give their time and talents. He is keen to share that contributing does not have to be the same all the time and that you can have breaks and focus on one area in a particular period too. He gives the example of how in his spare time he watches Trac, where tickets about the software are logged, and looks where he might be able to help or think of solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “Anytime I find I can contribute to or make improvements in code-related areas, I will do as it is important to keep giving to the community. I enjoy crawling over meta, trac, GitHub and the different places that are requesting help. There is always somewhere you can help. At the moment, my focus is code and translations. I always try to save time to help these two areas. It is like you give and you get, you learn things. You meet amazing people and opportunities arrive.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finding your path in WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505.jpeg?resize=768%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Juan sat in a street cafe surrounded by parked motorcycles\" class=\"wp-image-12527\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=1152%2C1536&amp;ssl=1 1152w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?resize=1536%2C2048&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/03/Juanfra_1505-scaled.jpeg?w=1920&amp;ssl=1 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Life is about experiences, it is about the people you surround yourself with and trying to do what you love.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we&#8217;re talking about who WordPress is built for. I was talking to a group of contributors last week and we encountered some questions around just who WordPress is built for. And it&#8217;s a question that you&#8217;ll find any time that you&#8217;re working on user testing or on triaging tickets, and especially when that comes up when you look at the big picture, roadmap sorts of things. The easiest answer for this question is, of course, everyone because WordPress&#8217; mission is to democratize publishing and that should be available to everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>[00:01:11]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, everyone is a really big target and certainly doesn&#8217;t help get your mind around the people that you&#8217;re wanting to actually build it for, the people that you actually want to be able to use your product, your software on a day-to-day basis. So let&#8217;s take a look at the one question that can help us figure out who it&#8217;s built for today and how we get it to being something that&#8217;s built forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, there&#8217;s a basic premise of open source that informs this thought. And that premise is that we are citizens of a community of contributors therefore the decisions are made by the people who show up. In general, I believe that to be true, though, I also believe that some basic qualifications are needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:50]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with that in mind, the one question that can help us figure out who a software is built for is this: how do your active contributors see themselves? I would bet that most contributors to open source software projects, like WordPress, are developers of some sort, it is sort of written right into the definition of the project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you work on software, then you need developers. And what I love about WordPress, in particular, is that we do work to include contributors who are not developers. Yet it still remains true that there is a fairly high level of technical knowledge required to actively contribute.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:2:25]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which kind of brings us to the second half of the original question of how can we make sure that WordPress can be something that&#8217;s built for everyone? The answer to this one is easy to say, hard to do, and that is to make sure to include them as co-creators in the development process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve talked about co-creators in open source before. It&#8217;s this idea that people who use the software every day are likely to know the biggest pain points. So if you want your software to be used by people who don&#8217;t know HTML, talk to a bunch of people who don&#8217;t know HTML about how it is to use your software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want your software to be mostly used by enterprise agencies, talk to enterprise agencies, but also ask them what their clients hate, because everyone has more than one stakeholder. And I know that I said this already, but it bears repeating that, obviously, this is all very easy to say and hard to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:3:20]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what is my best guess for the how-to-do part for WordPress? There are three things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first is testing. This not only helps bring in new contributors and helps train future contributors, which I&#8217;ve talked about on the podcast before. But testing also gives us a higher chance of actionable feedback from folks who don&#8217;t necessarily spend time directly in the WordPress project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frequently the feedback that we do get that is just kind of undirected and ad hoc is exactly that– it is undirected and ad hoc and is then hard to follow up on and make sure that we understand what was wrong and how we can help fix it. And so testing is important for that. And testing it turns out is important for a bunch of things. When you&#8217;re working in open source.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing is support. So checking in with support teams at hosts, as well as the hardworking support teams in the project. And that can really help us to get early indications of what difficulties exist now. They have routinely seen problems and issues that are raised in support forums, and from their everyday users that they are providing support to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That probably could be fixed in WordPress if we had a good understanding of just what was not going right, how many people really needed it to go better, and what our targets were to fix that particular problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:4:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing is communication. I know that I&#8217;ve gone on record in many places as saying that most of our problems at the end of the day are communication problems. And I&#8217;m going on record about it again here in this podcast, establishing better communication patterns with users is key.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That can be a multi-year project in itself. And even after that, it&#8217;s going to be an ongoing journey. But it is one of the many things that WordCamps and other WordPress events have given to us over the years, an opportunity to really hear from and see the struggles that people who are not building with WordPress every day, or literally building WordPress every day are actually having.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:5:34]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now that you&#8217;ve heard my small list of way too big things, that brings us to our regular small list of big things. The first thing is that WordCamp Europe is still looking for volunteers. If you&#8217;ve never done that before, I think it&#8217;s quite fun. You get to meet a lot of people and the team of organizers is super fun, but I&#8217;ll leave a link for you in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a new code-free way to contribute through the photo directory. That team is just getting started and still is working toward building out its programs. So now&#8217;s a good time to drop in and just kind of see what they are up to. And finally, a reminder that we do have contributors who are affected by the war in Ukraine right now. I will reshare the list of humanitarian organizations in case you missed them a couple of weeks ago as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:6:21]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for this WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"12451\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"WordPress 5.9.2 Security and Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/03/wordpress-5-9-2-security-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 11 Mar 2022 02:24:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"5.9\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12421\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:367:\"WordPress 5.9.2&#160;is now available!

I have Matt here with me today because we want to acknowledge that we are once again at the start of a very difficult time. Neither of us would presume to know what it&#8217;s like to be at the heart of such massive disruption in our lives. But who would we be if we didn&#8217;t stop and check in with you all, the project that we hold so dear? And with that, I&#8217;ll hand it right over to you, Matt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello everyone. First, I want to thank Josepha for inviting me to join the WordPress Briefing to share what’s been on my mind in light of recent global events.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:37</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been listening and watching events escalate in Ukraine, often in a state of shock. The scale alone is hard to take in. I mean, in the last 7 days, more than 500,000 people have fled their homes, more refugees are expected every day. The downstream humanitarian crises of the invasion are unimaginable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>00:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And seeing destruction in the world we live in is confusing, disconcerting, and difficult. In my experience, open source and WordPress bring people together; people from other countries and cultures, people that we know as friends and colleagues. Technology connects us, regardless of where we are. Nothing can negate the bad things happening in the world, but when I see how this community of contributors collaborates, regardless of borders, you all remind me of the good in the world every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>01:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I firmly believe that the web can be an equalizer and a force for good in the world. To me, the WordPress project is the epitome of goodness—everyone has a voice, a platform, and a community. You have the power to make your corner of the world, and the web, a sanctuary for those who need it—especially now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>01:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you or someone you know is affected by this war, I encourage you to be present as the ramifications unfold. While we may all feel fatigued and have a sense of languishing from the past two years of the Covid pandemic, the gift of time and support for one another cannot be overstated. I&#8217;m confident that every single person in the WordPress community will approach the situation in Ukraine with sensitivity and understanding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>02:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I invite you to join me in standing with those in the world working to end conflict and working toward a world of peace, promise, and opportunity. If you&#8217;re looking for a way to help support the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, I will offer some suggested NGOs, or Non-Governmental Organizations, that provide assistance to local peacebuilders in the region.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matt Mullenweg&nbsp; </strong>02:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In closing, please know that my thoughts are with everyone in our community. I know that my words here can’t change anything there, but I hope that we all remember that words of support are never unwelcome. And we can never know when a little human kindness can help someone share the invisible heaviness in their heart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for that, Matt.

In 2007, Tonya started to face health challenges that had an impact on all that she had known.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>“My career defined me. It was my canvas and my art. When it was gone, I did not recognize myself.</strong></p><cite>Tonya Mork</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>One day, she woke up at home ready to visit a client’s facility where her firm was building a robotic system. She said: “As I headed for the door, I fell to my knees, as this wave of pain crushed down on my chest.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doctors diagnosed her with a very rare heart disease that caused her blood vessels to spasm, cutting off blood to whatever was downstream of the blockage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months later, she was diagnosed with a second rare and more serious condition, related to the migraines from which she had been suffering. Combined with her heart condition, this made every migraine attack life-threatening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For nearly seven years, the unexpected changes to her health left her mostly homebound and constantly monitored. This meant she had to close her engineering firm and say goodbye to staff and clients. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“My career defined me. It was my canvas and my art. When it was gone, I was lost. I didn’t recognize myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in her darkest hour, she found her strength. Tonya made a choice to move forward, and make the most of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When you are at rock bottom, you have to make a decision or else it will consume you. My decision was that I chose to be happy,” said Tonya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of Tonya’s first steps was to start writing a blog using WordPress. In this she shared insights on how to find peace and joy in any situation. She wrote about kindness and helping one another.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The joy of making solutions through WordPress became a way for Tonya to accept her new life and not feel as limited by her health. She wanted purpose, and in WordPress, she found just that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya felt she could do something worthwhile in the virtual world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"a-ray-of-hope-for-tonya\">A ray of hope for Tonya</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?resize=1000%2C750&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12327\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya.jpg?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2013, Tonya’s health deteriorated further. She was admitted into intensive care and was diagnosed with a third rare disease, this time related to her autoimmunity. She was not expected to survive this time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following what she describes as a ‘miraculous recovery,’ she became stronger and was able to stop relying on a wheelchair. She used the energy from working on websites to keep going. “WordPress kept my mind alive,” said Tonya.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She had first used WordPress for her engineering firm’s intranet. But when she discovered the software’s full potential and the collaborative opportunities of open source, it opened a new world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>&#8220;Finding WordPress helped me to find myself again&#8221;</p><cite>Tonya Mork</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>During the years which followed, she donated her time to build some WordPress websites and plugins. She said: “Through giving my time, I was able to do something other than sit in isolation.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya was amazed by the sharing in open source in general and in WordPress in particular. She said: “I was amazed to see people sharing so much information freely with one another. In my former engineering world, information was proprietary. Throughout my career, I had worked to break down those silos and help anyone to understand complex systems. I was drawn to this open community.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She also became aware that WordPress developers were hungry to learn more about development. She wanted to be part of the solution with her passion for teaching and the knowledge she had gained in industry.<br><br>She said: “Finding WordPress helped me to find myself again. Here in this community, I was able to feel like a person again, not a sick one, but a professional with something to give.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As her interest in the software grew, Tonya decided to start a non-profit where she turned to WordPress to build the websites. This re-sparked her interest in programming. She said: “I wanted to really know the code and understand what made it tick.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The realization led Tonya to start the WP Developers’ Club, which in turn spawned <a href=\"https://knowthecode.io/\">Know the Code</a>, to help educate individual developers, and is still used today.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"from-helping-wordpress-companies-to-working-on-wordpress-core\">From helping WordPress companies to working on WordPress Core</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya-with-dog.jpg?resize=300%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Tonya pictured with her dog\" class=\"wp-image-12328\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya-with-dog.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/tonya-with-dog.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya went on to work with big and medium size WordPress companies helping their developers and supporting them in raising their firms’ leverage with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By late 2020, she knew she wanted to do even more with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In February 2021, Tonya joined an international firm in the ecosystem and began working closely on WordPress Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, WordPress Core was pulling together a new Triage team. Tonya started volunteering on that team to find collaborative solutions, and help others do so. In 2020 for <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/simone/\">WordPress 5.6 Simone</a>, she became the release’s Triage lead, and again for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-7/\">WordPress 5.7 Esperanza</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, she became a Test Team Rep and helped to expand the team and is an advocate for the value of testing and feedback in the release development process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"a-new-successful-chapter-with-wordpress-5-9\">A new, successful chapter with WordPress 5.9</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=1024%2C480&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Tonya was one of the notable contributors to the WordPress 5.9 release featured in this picture.\" class=\"wp-image-12329\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=1024%2C480&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=300%2C141&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=768%2C360&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=1536%2C719&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/02/WP59-thumbnail-jb.png?resize=2048%2C959&amp;ssl=1 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Tonya’s passion for the software and getting people involved in its growth continued. For the WordPress 5.9 release in 2021, she took on the role of both the Core Tech Lead and the Release Coordinator. As this was a big release and included the first major implementation of Full Site Editing, it had many moving parts and hundreds of contributors. She was able to share the skills she had learned in communication and project management from her days streamlining and documenting engineering software and processes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the first 24 hours of WordPress 5.9 landing, it had more than 10 million downloads—and 17 formally reported bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"giving-back-to-open-source\">Giving back to open source</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now in what Tonya describes as her third chapter. She said: “I’m a very different person from the engineer I used to know. What really matters in this world is when you reach out and make a difference in someone’s life.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She feels she has found her purpose in this life. “I’m on a mission to give back and make a difference. Teaching is how I will do it. And in WordPress I have found my professional home, and I have all this software knowledge that I just want to share.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"share-the-stories\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"contributors-to-this-feature\">Contributors to this feature</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Tonya Mork (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/hellofromtonya/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>hellofromtonya</a>) for sharing her story. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interviews and feature by Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>) and Mary Baum (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>).

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project. Some insight into the community that supports it and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy &#8211; here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:00:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a non-mailbag mailbag question that I would like to answer for y&#8217;all today. Non-mailbag because no one actually emailed me about it and mailbag because Twitter is basically like a giant mailbag. And I do get a lot of DMS about this particular topic. If you want to send something to my actual WP Briefing mailbag, you can send it to <a href=\"mailto:wpbriefing@worpress.org\">wpbriefing@worpress.org</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:06]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the question that I frequently get asked in my DMS on Twitter is: what is Five for the Future? It&#8217;s not always that tidy the question, but that still is the question we&#8217;re answering today. So if you take a casual survey of active contributors to the WordPress project, the high-level answer that you&#8217;re likely to get to that question is “a way to remind people to give back to the project.” Or, if you run in more business-y circles, you might hear that it is an initiative that encourages companies to give back 5% of their resources.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:01:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And both of those answers are true. So a quick mini-history lesson; the original concept of Five for the Future came from Matt Mullenweg in 2014. There&#8217;s a lovely blog post on it that I will link in the notes below, but it was essentially a call to any companies experiencing success with WordPress to contribute back to the project and make sure that the project was a success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:07]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial program then included outreach recognition, et cetera, proposed in 2017 by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/liljimmi/\">Tracy Levesque</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/iandunn/\">Ian Dunn</a>. Then that was defined and formalized with the help of the WordPress community in 2018. And then, in 2019, we had our first trial run with entire dedicated teams sponsored by companies inside the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:02:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the mini-history lesson chronology of this program. The intentions that informed the work of building the program in 2017 have become a bit lost to the ages. So I&#8217;m here to share it with you. The basic heart and soul of the Five for the Future program is to make sure that there is a way to refresh the commons of the WordPress community and ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:00]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as a result, ensure that the common resources of WordPress are available long after we have stopped being available to care for them. If you are familiar with the concept of the tragedy of the commons, Five for the Future was created to help avoid that tragedy. There were two original goals for formalizing the program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one was to acknowledge companies that participated in Five for the Future by sponsoring contributors to work on the WordPress project. And the second was to motivate more companies to sponsor more volunteers. Either by hiring them and paying them to contribute or by assigning their existing employees to contribute to the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:03:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, it&#8217;s hard to quantify participation and hard to qualify what should be seen as an impactful contribution, which is why when the program was originally created, it was in partnership with team reps and community members who were active at the time. There are many posts around that discuss the next steps for this program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:07]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I&#8217;m looking through them, the next steps revolve around some of the hardest and most important questions that we have to answer as a project and as stewards of open source. Those questions are things like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li> How do we remain true to these gloriously subversive values of WordPress and open source while also finding a way to thoughtfully secure our organization&#8217;s future?</li><li>Does contributing without the expectation of reciprocity hold up when we are looking at how to acknowledge contributors who sustain us?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re familiar with Elinor Ostrom&#8217;s award-winning work, Governing the Commons, you may also be wondering how this particular program aligns with her eight principles designed to sustain organizations like ours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:04:57]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an aside to that last question, this particular program does not have all eight principles accounted for, but among WordPress&#8217;s many programs, we do account for most of them. Although imperfectly, as is the way with human beings, that&#8217;s probably a whole episode unto itself, I did want to quickly answer that particular question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:16]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to get back to my non-mailbag, mailbag question, if I had to tell you in the span of an elevator ride what Five for the Future was, this would be my answer. <strong>It is a v1 program with a dual goal of boldly declaring the need to refresh the shared resources of WordPress and offering the ways and means for communities and individuals alike to participate in refreshing those resources</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:05:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to learn more about the Five for the Future initiative, you can check out wordpress.org/5. Like literally just the number five. Or, if you want to learn more about the program that has grown from the Five for the Future initiative, you can check out the white paper that&#8217;s linked in the notes below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:11]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. Number one on my small list, the planning post for WordPress 6.0 is out. I&#8217;ve included a link in my massive list of links below. But it includes our best guess at timing, features that we intend to include, and a call for volunteers as well. So if you are looking for ways to give back, that is a clear and immediate option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:38]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on the list is if you are a team rep, don&#8217;t forget that we have daylight saving time ending and starting depending on your hemisphere within the month. If you move meetings, if you&#8217;re in a team that moves your meetings, discuss it now so that folks have time to adjust their calendars.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy [00:06:55]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing on my small list of big things is that there&#8217;s a suite of Full Site Editing courses that are now available on learn.wordpress.org. I will add that to my giant list of links below, but I encourage you to wander on over and see what all the fuss is about. I think the courses are excellent.

Most theme authors have been enqueuing Google Fonts from the Google CDN for better performance, but this method exposes visitors&#8217; IP addresses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The themes team strongly encourages the theme authors to update their themes,&#8221; Themes Team representative @benachi said in a recent <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2022/06/18/complying-with-gdpr-when-using-google-fonts/\">announcement</a>. &#8220;We recommend updating by switching to locally hosted webfonts. Luckily Google Fonts can be downloaded and bundled in a theme. Bundled font files allow users to host webfonts locally and comply with GDPR.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Themes Team is also considering banning remotely hosted fonts moving forward and will discuss at the next meeting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Core contributors are now working on <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55985\">updating all the default themes</a> from Twenty Twelve through Twenty Seventeen to use locally hosted webfonts. The task had previously been discussed but was renewed by <a href=\"https://de.wordpress.org/support/topic/google-fonts-werde-hier-abgemahnt-twentyseventeen-fonts/\">a recent topic in the German support forums</a>. A user created a small website using the Twenty Seventeen theme and said he has been threatened by a site visitor who cited the German court ruling. The ruling threatens a fine of €250,000.00 for each case of infringement or, alternatively, six months imprisonment, if the site owner does not comply and continues to provide Google with IP addresses through their use of Google Fonts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While in the newer default themes fonts got added as an asset, the older default themes remained untouched,&#8221; WordPress contributor Jessica Lyschik said. &#8220;This can cause issues with users not being aware of both the legal stuff and the fact that Google Fonts are directly used in default themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We think while it is still widely among plugins and other themes to use Google Fonts directly, the default themes of WordPress should be able to used risk-free and compliant with the GDPR.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Themes Team recommends authors refer to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentytwo/\">Twenty Twenty-Two</a> theme to learn how to bundle locally hosted webfont files using <code>theme.json</code>. Another option, for those using functions.php, is to follow the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/09/28/implementing-a-webfonts-api-in-wordpress-core/\" target=\"_blank\">Implementing a Webfonts API in WordPress Core</a> tutorial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many theme authors may not update their themes until forced to by a ban from WordPress.org. In the meantime, users might consider adding a plugin to host webfonts locally. WordPress developer Xaver Birsak has created a small single-purpose plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/local-google-fonts/\">Local Google Fonts</a> that automatically detects Google font sources and gives users the option to download them and use them locally.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Local Google Fonts admin screen\n\n\n\n<p>This plugin checks for fonts embedded via <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_enqueue_style/\"><code>wp_enqueue_style</code></a>. Users who are embedding Google fonts via <code>@import</code> will need to change that before using the plugin. It currently auto downloads new font versions if available. Birsak has created it as a set-it-and-forget it kind of plugin. This may be a good option for non-technical users who have a theme that hasn&#8217;t yet been updated by the author. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/local-google-fonts/\">Local Google Fonts</a> is available for free on WordPress.org.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 22:45:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"WPTavern: WordPress.org Forces Security Update for Critical Ninja Forms Vulnerability\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=135341\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-forces-security-update-for-critical-ninja-forms-vulnerability\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3390:\"<p>Late last week, Ninja Forms users received a forced security update from WordPress.org for a critical  PHP Object Injection vulnerability. This particular vulnerability can be exploited remotely without any authentication. It was publicly disclosed last week and patched in the latest version, 3.6.11. Patches were also backported to versions 3.0.34.2, 3.1.10, 3.2.28, 3.3.21.4, 3.4.34.2, and 3.5.8.4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wordfence noticed a back-ported security update in the form builder plugin, which has more than a million active installs. Threat analyst Chloe Chamberland explained the vulnerability in an <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2022/06/psa-critical-vulnerability-patched-in-ninja-forms-wordpress-plugin/\">advisory</a> alerting the company&#8217;s users:  </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We uncovered a code injection vulnerability that made it possible for unauthenticated attackers to call a limited number of methods in various Ninja Forms classes, including a method that unserialized user-supplied content, resulting in Object Injection. This could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code or delete arbitrary files on sites where a separate POP chain was present.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The vulnerability affects Ninja Forms&#8217; &#8220;Merge Tags&#8221; feature that auto-populates values from Post IDs and usernames, for example. Wordfence threat analyst Ramuel Gall reverse engineered the vulnerability&#8217;s patches to create a working proof of concept. He found that it is possible to call various Ninja Forms classes that could be used for a wide range of exploits, including complete site takeover. Chamberland reports there is evidence to suggest the vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.org&#8217;s forced security updates are a mitigation effort used in rare instances where the vulnerability is particularly severe and affects a large number of users. More than 680,000 sites were updated on June 14. This PHP object injection vulnerability scores 9.8 on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System, but it has not yet been given a CVE ID. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Reviewing <a href=\"https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-15289/product_id-31215/Ninjaforms-Ninja-Forms.html\">previous CVE ID&#8217;s</a> for Ninja Forms, this is the most severe vulnerability in the plugin&#8217;s history. Ninja Forms&#8217; changelog doesn&#8217;t communicate the severity of the threat, categorizing it as a &#8220;security enhancement:&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>3.6.11 (14 JUNE 2022)</p><p><em>Security Enhancements</em><br />* Apply more strict sanitization to merge tag values</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Ninja Forms did not post about the security update on its blog or social media accounts.  Wordfence plans to update the text of its <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2022/06/psa-critical-vulnerability-patched-in-ninja-forms-wordpress-plugin/\">advisory</a> as the company learns more about how attackers are exploiting the vulnerability.

It also needs maintenance and if you want to contribute, the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wporg-gutenberg\">theme repo is available on GitHub</a>. What do you think about the new Gutenberg Landing page? Please share in the comments on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2022/06/16/gutenberg-landing-page-launched/\">post</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Matias Ventura</strong> published his <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/06/13/thinking-through-the-wordpress-admin-experience/\"><strong>thinking through the WordPress Admin experience</strong></a> following some lessons learned from the Site editor menu designs and behavior. <br />&#8220;Given the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/\">third phase of the current WordPress roadmap</a>&nbsp;has a focus around workflows and multiplayer, considerations around the various admin flows become all the more important.&#8221; he explained. The post takes a look at the various aspects: </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shell and Canvas</strong> &#8211; a full-screen view as the default experience with sub-menus sliding in and out of the screen. That way the admin can also give access to out of context information or configurations. The&nbsp;<strong>shell</strong>&nbsp;as awayfinder with drill-down panels and the&nbsp;<strong>canvas</strong>&nbsp;as the place to browse, manage, edit, customize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Home Button</strong> as it is now in the Dashboard or the Site editor has different targets, and it&#8217;s a place for confusion with many users. It&#8217;s meant to be a place to espace the inner most focus, and go one level higher. Hopefully with some breadcrumps to show the location clearly. &#8220;The aim of this interface element is to both give control and build familiarity to navigate away from any context.&#8221; Ventura wrote. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Make it&nbsp;Extensible</strong> is the headline of the next section. Given the nature of WordPress as extensible plattform for website, and its promise of backwards compatibility,  this seems like a given. I</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am particularily intrigued by the contemplations around <strong>&#8220;Make it Personal&#8221;.</strong> Customization of the Admin menu has long been plugin territory, and it would be great if that can become built-in functionality as it would also come with standards and guard rails for plugins and themes. Each user should be able to hide/show specific menu items they need. I would love the &#8220;recently visited areas as some sort of stack&#8221; feature. Most of the time, i only do a few things on certain web sites, and if those activities could be available as Quick links that would be fabulous. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are more sections in these early sharing of creative thinking about the future WPAdmin. There is certainly nothing set in stone or even remotely concrete available, but it&#8217;s worth reading and also sharing your opinion on the post. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-2 wp-block-group has-light-background-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><strong>🎙️ </strong> New episode: <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-68-wordcamp-europe-gutenberg-13-4-and-wordpress-6-1/\">Gutenberg Changelog #68 –  WordCamp Europe, Gutenberg 13.4 and WordPress 6.1</a> with Birgit Pauli-Haack and Mary Job, and special guest: Dave Smith </p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/references/keeping-up-with-gutenberg-index/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8220;Keeping up with Gutenberg &#8211; Index 2022&#8221;</a>&nbsp;</strong><br />A chronological list of the WordPress Make Blog posts from various teams involved in Gutenberg development: Design, Theme Review Team, Core Editor, Core JS, Core CSS, Test and Meta team from Jan. 2021 on.

This is essentially the same as the export option in the Site Editor</li><li><strong>Create a child theme</strong><br />Creates a new child theme with the currently activated theme as a parent.</li><li><strong>Clone the current theme</strong><br />Creates a new theme by cloning the activated theme. The resulting theme will have all of the assets of the activated theme combined with the user’s changes.</li><li><strong>Overwrite theme files</strong><br />Saves user’s changes to the theme files and deletes the user’s changes.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s in its first version. The team would appreciate some more testing and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/create-block-theme\">start discussions on GitHub issues</a> or send in your PRs. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"2-word-press-events\">WordPress Events</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"5-s\">Social Learning Spaces</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>June 27, 2022 &#8211; 1 pm EDT /  17:00 UTC<br /><strong><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/wordpress-social-learning/events/286560368/\">Hello Blocks!

Matt is the co-founder of WordPress. And as a result, he&#8217;s been a user of WordPress for as long as anybody. We recorded this podcast while at WordCamp Europe in Portugal, a couple of weeks ago. It&#8217;s a wide ranging discussion, covering a lot of ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:01:41] We start out with Matt&#8217;s reflections of WordPress at 19 years old. Which aspects of the project would he change if he had his time over and which parts is he proud of? Did Covid, and the restrictions around community events, have an impact upon the project, given that much of the time dedicated to WordPress is done by volunteers? What lessons have we learned about events like WordCamp Europe?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:08] In recent news, and for the first time, there&#8217;s been some data pointing to the fact that WordPress&#8217; market share might have flattened out. Is this a cause for concern?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:20] Where are we at with WordPress right now, given that it&#8217;s changing the scope of what non-technical users can do with it out of the box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:30] We then get into some more personal matters, including how Matt manages his time over the variety of projects he&#8217;s involved with. And does he regard advances in artificial intelligence as always positive?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:02:43] You might notice that the sound is a bit patchy in places. This was a function of the environment we were in. There&#8217;s a few booms on the mic here and there, but it&#8217;s certainly listenable. If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading over to WP tavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:07] And so without further delay, I bring you Matt Mullenweg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:17] I am joined on the podcast today by Matt Mullenweg. Hello Matt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:22] Howdy, good to see you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:23] Yeah. They&#8217;re really nice to see you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:25] As far as I&#8217;m aware, you&#8217;re one of two people who can claim to go all the way back with WordPress. And it&#8217;s been just last week, 19 years, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:35] Yeah, that was a pretty exciting anniversary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:37] Yeah, does that kind of stuff fill you with nostalgia? Do you sort of look back and think, wow, what a journey this has been? Or are always focusing on the future?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:45] You know, I am very future-focused personally, but it&#8217;s partially because I have a terrible memory. No really. It&#8217;s one of the reasons I started blogging. I learned a lot from the archives of my blog that I forgot. It&#8217;s also why I&#8217;m not too attached to like, arguing about the past. It&#8217;s like, you remember it differently. It&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;ll even go with your version, but what&#8217;s happening next? What are we doing in the future? And I try to live my life primarily oriented towards moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:12] The reason I laughed is because I&#8217;m exactly the same. I more or less everything that happened 30 minutes ago. But looking back over those 19 years, what would be some of the highlights? So I&#8217;m forcing you to be nostalgic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:25] Hm. You know to me, it&#8217;s all about the people. Like we created lots of great stuff together, and still are. And so there&#8217;s definitely things like the first plugins, the first themes, the first international versions of WordPress with the Wiziwig coming in, which was quite controversial. And then Gutenberg coming in, which is quite controversial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:46] That&#8217;s part of why I dipped back into more active WordPress stuff day to day for a while there. But, I really think of the people. From the early folks like Mike Little, some who&#8217;ve passed away like Alex King. To the incredible array of people we have here today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:00] And my favorite part about WordCamps, what I miss the most was just meeting folks. Reconnecting with people who I&#8217;ve seen before, or just meeting people who, lives have been touched by WordPress in some way. And I&#8217;ve never, we&#8217;ve never run into each other before. I really enjoy that side of it. I learn a lot too. So it actually is very helpful for me in terms of thinking about the roadmap for WordPress. Just the stories. I hear, the things I see in the booths, the talks that happen. I definitely learn a ton from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:29] Staying on nostalgic thing, are there any bits which you think, I wish it had played out differently, bits where you look back and you think, oh, WordPress could have gone in that direction, or there was a moment in time where we could have done this, and we we didn&#8217;t do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:40] Hmm. Probably would have left the Rest API as a plugin, or maybe skipped straight to GraphQL or something. We did need to support all the feeds other than RSS2. We probably didn&#8217;t need all the others. Gosh, what else? I definitely, if I could go back to the very early days, we&#8217;ve always been really big on backwards compatibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:00] And so there&#8217;s a few database tables that are just inconsistent in their namings, you know, as capital ID or something like that. Going all the way back to the B2 days, even before WordPress. So I kind of wish we had just renamed some of those early, actually it might be easier to do it now because no one accesses those tables directly anymore, but some of those minor things kinda.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:18] I&#8217;d say broadly on the whole year you got it fairly right? I&#8217;m staying on the nostalgic bit, but this is the last couple of years. I mean, everybody knows what I mean by that sentence. The last couple of years, Covid and so on. How&#8217;s that been for WordPress in general? Everybody started staring at screens and looking at Zoom and, I feel that we were as prepared as an industry, as any. We got the zoom calls. We knew how to get the computer to do all those things. We had the mics, we had the cameras, but yet it wore pretty thin, after a period of time. And I wonder if the community, was sort of slowly leached away a little bit and I if there&#8217;s any of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:56] I don&#8217;t think in a way that was unique to WordPress. Like you said, we&#8217;re fortunate that we&#8217;ve always connected online. It&#8217;s a fairly positive community. People are very supportive of each other. Competitors grabbed dinner together. What we miss was definitely these events like what&#8217;s happening right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:11] It&#8217;s always been part of our magic sauce, secret sauce, if you will. Like we work remotely, but then when we get together, it makes it that much more special. And then more broadly, I think it&#8217;s just, you can&#8217;t ignore the impact all this has just had in people&#8217;s lives. And if there&#8217;s something going on in your life, you&#8217;re gonna have less energy for work or volunteering or other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:32] And certainly if it&#8217;s anything health related, right. All the priorities melt away, right? When you, or a loved one facing a health challenge. So I think that, so many parts of the world are back to normal or like nothing happened, but it&#8217;s easy to forget, like the vast human costs of what we&#8217;ve been through. And it&#8217;s still ongoing for many people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:49] In terms of the contributions to the project, did that wick away? Is there the same engagement today, well, maybe let&#8217;s say three months ago, as there was two years ago, to core and all the other bits and pieces, or was that a struggle to keep going?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:07] I don&#8217;t have the numbers in front of me, but if I recall there was a boost at the beginning, when we&#8217;re stuck at home. And I think like, as people started returning, to normal life, it dipped a bit, which makes sense, right there probably like have saved up. I know I&#8217;ve been going to like a thousand weddings. It feels like everyone in the world is doing their wedding. So I think there&#8217;s just some natural time that goes back to life, which by the way is great, because then we&#8217;ll return to equilibrium there. If you looked at 6.0 though, amazing number of contributors, contributor day yesterday was way over populated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:42] Yeah, it was so overpopulated, there was a struggle with food.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:44] We literally ran out of food and we always over half that. So I think that&#8217;s showing that there is a, um, to say WordPress can continue to serve the needs of the world and our community. There&#8217;s no reason for it to, uh, not continue to grow and get more involved. That flywheels, it gets more users, some percentage of those contribute. And then of course we have programs like five for the future. That I feel like every open source project should have, but it&#8217;s very mature in WordPress where it&#8217;s just a cultural mores of people, for whom they get a lot from WordPress, take a little bit of time to give back. And that again is part of it. It&#8217;s all the people at the end. I think I&#8217;m going to say that 10 times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:22] No, it&#8217;s okay. I don&#8217;t know if you know, but apparently the two thousand seven hundred people who are registered, apparently 1,700 are brand new. Never been any WordPress event. About 60% of the people who are in this building have never been. So it feels if that was the thing it&#8217;s back in reverse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:41] It makes me wonder what the 2022 WordCamp Europe would be without a global pandemic we are just are coming out of and like, kind of in, in many places still. So yeah, 2,700 that&#8217;s amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:54] What do you think about events like this? It&#8217;s a generic question, but what are your thoughts? I mean, you&#8217;ve got such a different perspective, I guess, than somebody like me who turns up, attend events and go to people speaking and go to various different bits and pieces. What is this for you? Is it an enjoyable experience?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:11] I mean, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s what I do too. You know, I&#8217;ll drop it in the back and check out talks. If for whatever reason not in the room often I&#8217;m live streaming them. I would say the difference for me is like, I leave a pretty under the radar life generally. It&#8217;s not like people recognize me or anything like that. But at WordCamps, definitely. So I go stopped sometimes every five feet, to take a picture or talk to people, but you know what, that&#8217;s kind of why I&#8217;m here too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:40] Like if that&#8217;s a any way I can be of service to the community, sign me up for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:44] Maybe that was the target of the question. Is it a strange thing to drop into for a period of time where life generally is normal and then it&#8217;s extraordinary for a bit, and then it goes back to whatever the normal is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:57] You know, I also just love talking about WordPress and technology. So I&#8217;m doing that for fun anyway. I&#8217;d say the main difference from my normal life is being recognized, which is just kind of a bizarre human experience. I never want to be actual, famous. Keep me out of the Daily Mail or The Post or whatever it is like. I&#8217;m happy to be well known among a community creating things like we do in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:20] So yeah, that&#8217;s kind of fun. And also the to and from, because like all the restaurants around. The planes to and from the event. You&#8217;ll just run into people and, you know, I could take a hundred flights without anyone ever stopping me. Yeah, my backpack actually has the WordPress logo embroided on it, but it&#8217;s black on black, so it&#8217;s a little subtle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:36] Normally no one recognizes. But often to or from a WordCamp, people will be like, oh, hey. But even I can go to WordCamps. I remember, often before WordCamp US, I&#8217;ll go to a bunch of the smaller ones. Just to kind of test out my material, like a comedian, playing smaller clubs before the big ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:51] I remember going to working at Scranton, I think it was. Uh, Pennsylvania. I forget where Scranton is, someplace, um, and smaller WordCamp, maybe 110 people, which are some of my favorites, but, you know, we sat down at the lunch. No one knows who I am. They&#8217;re like, what do you do? And then after my talk, they were like, oh wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:08] You&#8217;re like, you did that. And so it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s also fun to just kind of be like a secret shopper, if you will. Like often I&#8217;ll just sit down at random tables or go over to people. And, uh, again, like I said, I learn a ton, and sometimes when people don&#8217;t know who I am, I&#8217;m able to learn even more because they are more unguarded and more relaxed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:26] These kinds of events feel to me almost like the glue that binds so much more together. These are three days where all sorts of new relationships are forged and old relationships are rekindled, and it feels like there&#8217;s been a great, big chasm. They&#8217;ve been missing. And, I&#8217;m just really glad they&#8217;re back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:45] It&#8217;s funny, one of the things I&#8217;ve said that gets quoted the most, like on Instagram posts and stuff, is technology is best when it brings people together. And that really came out of the WordCamp experience. It&#8217;s a tremendous amount of work, and this is where I&#8217;d actually like to call out and thank the WordCamp Europe team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:00] They really push the bar every year and raise it. Right. I have a little more involved with US. Every time Europe happens I&#8217;m like, man, we got to up our game. And I know it&#8217;s exhausting. Everyone like, you know, needs a break at the end. But wow. Really is one of the, I think one of the best contributions to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:18] They&#8217;re all wearing black t-shirts and there&#8217;s black T-shirts everywhere. You know, there&#8217;s hundreds and hundreds of people who are giving up their time. And It&#8217;s amazing, you know, they&#8217;re doing it because they want to do it. There&#8217;s no coercion there. They&#8217;re really keen on the community and it&#8217;s this lovely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:33] It&#8217;s a lot of fun too. Often my sister, she&#8217;s been to, I think, WordCamp US and Europe until this one. Unfortunately she tested positive before the flight, so she ended up staying home, wasn&#8217;t feeling well. But often she&#8217;ll volunteer at like the check-in stage or something like that. But she now loves it for the people, you know, like she&#8217;s a fan of mine obviously. We&#8217;re brother and sister for a long time, she has so many friends here now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:56] I know for a fact that there&#8217;s people here just in the few people that I know who&#8217;ve brought their husband or wife and they&#8217;d just in, cause it&#8217;s a nice thing to do. Staring into the future, forever, it seems, the numbers for WordPress up, up, up, up, up, 25%, 40%, 43%, whatever it is. I think, you know where this is going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:15] Recently, I don&#8217;t know how dubious the statistics are. There&#8217;s this possible leveling off. Is any of that of interest to you? Is growth the thing, or is it, is there something else? Are you thinking about that at any point? Does it worry you or give you pause for thought?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:31] I think growth is the result. So if we create something that&#8217;s accessible, well designed, solves people&#8217;s problems, we should grow. And so, yeah, it&#8217;s concerning to me when we don&#8217;t grow. That number is going to be a little wonky over the next year, year and a half, because as you&#8217;re probably aware, Alexa, the toolbar is shut down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:51] So even though they&#8217;re still providing data, the W3Techs, that data is more stale than it used to be and will, I think degrade over time and eventually W3Techs are switching to a different data set. I forget which one it&#8217;s called. So I don&#8217;t know that off the top of my head, sorry, my computer&#8217;s over there, but on Built With, Built With is something else that indexes the whole web and says how many it is. We&#8217;ve generally talked about the W3Techs number, which I think got up to like 42 or 43% before it started to wobble a little bit. Built With had us at like 30 something percent. I think the answer is somewhere in between there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:23] So I can see the W3Techs number coming down, maybe even 15 or 20%, uh, regardless of the actual underlying fundamentals of WordPress. And luckily we have some other of data that we get back, and the wordpress.org plugin directory from the update pings, things like that, that show the health of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:40] Uh, so those are always what I look at as the leading metrics. So we keep an eye on those. If there were to see a big migration, we would definitely take a look at the why, and see if there&#8217;s something we can improve in the software. And then finally, I&#8217;m a little less worried least at the moment because I&#8217;d really like to switch Tumblr over to WordPress, which is, well half a billion blogs. There&#8217;s a lot of Tumblrs out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:03] And of course not all active, so it won&#8217;t move the number that much, but, yeah, a good amount. I&#8217;m very excited to bring that part of the web, which is so vibrant, has such a strong community and has a demographic, you know, younger, more female, than we might normally have at a WordPress event. Having it be like an on-ramp to the WordPress world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:20] Some of the commentary around that, whatever that was, this leveling off, was around things like, well maybe WordPress, there&#8217;s a lot of work to do in terms of performance and things like that. And I know that there&#8217;s initiatives in place and things are being done. I just wondered if there was anything you had on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:38] I think we need to improve every single part of WordPress. And there was some performance data. I think is it, Alaine talked about today in his presentation? That shows that some WordPress sites are not as performant as some others. Now, the tough thing is I think you need to adjust to that per dollar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:57] So, you know, comparing it to essentially a hosted platform, like Squarespace that people might be paying $25 a month. To a web host you might be paying like $4 a month for is not an apples to apples comparison. There&#8217;s going to be some performance differential there. And of course, one reason why so many people use WordPress, especially globally is the accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:16] The job that the web hosts do, making it extremely affordable. You know, the average Shopify subscriber spends $1,200 per year. Average WordPress subscriber, it&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know cause it&#8217;s across so many hosts, it would be closer to like a hundred dollars a year, maybe even less when you look at like how reasonable a lot of these hosting plans are, but definitely anything we could do in Core is helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:39] And it&#8217;s also part of why, I think part of the story of the past 10 years of WordPress has been our really close partnerships with all the hosts. So the auto upgrade almost every well, every major host upgrades by default. Getting them on the new PHP versions, which actually have huge performance increases. PHP seven doubles performance essentially. So helping them be on the edge of the technology adoption curve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:01] But it&#8217;s not true, I&#8217;d strongly disagree that WordPress is slow. In fact, WordPress sites can be some of the fastest ones out there, but when you think of 40% of the web, a lot of them on less expensive hosting providers, it&#8217;s going to pull our overall numbers down. If you&#8217;re looking at all sites, not just the fastest ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:20] Gutenberg WordPress 5.0. At seminal moment, everything changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:25] Yeah. It was a good one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:27] There&#8217;s been a lot, there&#8217;s been a lot that&#8217;s changed since then. I&#8217;m just wondering over the course of those, what is that? Three years, some, three years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:34] Yeah, right about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:35] How you feel that&#8217;s gone. was a messaging thing at the beginning, you know, how, how did it get rolled out. But it feels to me as if the people who are developing on top of it more and more and more. Are getting excited and the talk is more and more and more about the possibilities and what&#8217;s going to be possible. So just that really. Are you pleased with the direction it&#8217;s going in? Where we&#8217;re at now, full site editing, all of those, block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:59] I&#8217;m pretty thrilled with it. Of course, I&#8217;m an impatient person. So I would love to move faster. But the truth is in 2022, if you&#8217;re not building a site on Gutenberg by default, you&#8217;re kind of setting it up for obsolescence or really expensive upgrade paths in the future. It is so capable. I think people underestimate how much you can do with Core blocks</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:21] Like without adding any of these block ad-ons or anything. And yet also, that&#8217;s such a clear roadmap, so many improvements are coming in every release. It was just at 6.0. I&#8217;d like to move us to be more releases per year. You know, maybe we can get to four per year instead of three, but it&#8217;s coming along. I&#8217;m thrilled with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:37] And other CMSs are starting to copy it, and we&#8217;re getting Gutenberg and a lot more places too, which is also exciting. Um, Gutenberg is live for Tumblr by the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:47] Is the intention that it&#8217;s the editor for the web, basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:49] A hundred percent. It&#8217;s bigger than WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:51] It&#8217;ll be everywhere and ubiquitous. So on the phone and on the, whatever CMS that you&#8217;re using and the whole thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:58] Yeah. And there was this announcement for something called the block protocol, which I think, if you look at it, it&#8217;s exactly what we&#8217;ve been doing with Gutenberg and they probably should just adopt a Gutenberg and then like build from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:07] Yeah. That was a really interesting project. The idea that it&#8217;s completely interoperable across everything. Yeah. Really, really, really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:14] That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing. We have the mobile versions for iOS and Android. I believe we&#8217;re relicensing those right now to be even more open. So they&#8217;re easier to embed in commercial apps. And then of course the web version is getting pretty robust. And it&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s weird edge cases that you start to deal with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:29] There was one I found the other day actually through a friend. This is why I love doing tech support and people talking to me about the problems with WordPress. I think it was copying and pasting from Facebook images. So they had a lot of their photos on Facebook and they would right click to click copy and paste and in Gutenberg, what it was doing was making that a link to the image, versus actually uploading the image. And so, because it was to like a private URL, it would break for other people. But it would look normal to that person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:59] This was just a workflow no one has pointed out to us. It was like pretty easy to fix once we knew about it. But, it was interesting because one thing we do when something like that comes up is we look at other editors and see which other editors support that use case. Actually Google docs did. So at some point, Google docs figured this out, but a bunch of other editors did. Google docs is actually one of the software projects I repect the most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:22] I entirely agree. I&#8217;m waiting for the day when, um, we can do the concurrent editing, that will be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:26] Oh my goodness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:27] It&#8217;s almost as if that&#8217;s the minimum requirement now. I&#8217;ve got so used to using Google docs and seeing the other people contributing at the same time. I remember the experience of seeing that for the first time and thinking what that&#8217;s voodoo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:39] How, did that happen? But you you&#8217;re happy. You&#8217;re pleased with the development and you&#8217;re pleased with the way it&#8217;s looking?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:45] No, I&#8217;m impatient. I&#8217;m really proud of what we&#8217;ve done, but there&#8217;s so much more to do. And especially if we&#8217;re trying to make the editor for the entire web, it&#8217;s even bigger than WordPress. I think that&#8217;s going to have such a benefit, to both developments, like speed of development. It&#8217;s not unlike web components or other things like we&#8217;ll have these standard things everyone can use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:06] And then there&#8217;s also usability because users will be able to learn how blocks work, once, and then create almost anything. Like how cool is that? It&#8217;s like a fundamental, literally fundamental building block of the web, almost like the DNA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:17] I&#8217;m going to phrase this in a way which I suspect you&#8217;ll push back on, but let&#8217;s see where we go. The five for the future initiative. That would be so great if everybody was a part of that. And I wonder if you would like more people to be a part of that? Whether or not there&#8217;s some inertia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:36] I&#8217;m struggling to find the words. The speed of everything could go more rapidly. Everything could happen more quickly. And that speaks to your impatience. If more people were able and willing to step up for that initiative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:49] You know, I value even if people just have one hour, once a month. You know, five for the future isn&#8217;t meant to say you need to do 5% or nothing. It&#8217;s just meant to say that, Hey, if enough people do the 5%, WordPress will really thrive. But if not everyone does it, that&#8217;s okay too. In fact, you know, not everyone does it and doing pretty well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:12] It&#8217;s funny cause contributing, it&#8217;s kind of hard to start and maybe it&#8217;s intimidating to think like, oh, do I take like two hours a week to be part of WordPress. 5% of a 40 hour week or something. But it&#8217;s hard to stop too. Once get involved, it&#8217;s infectious because it&#8217;s such a great way to learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:28] It&#8217;s really great to be connected to something larger than yourself. Do some work and then see the ripples throughout the web or throughout WordCamps. It&#8217;s really fun to like overhear someone talking about something at a WordCamp that you were involved in building or contributing to or documenting or translating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:44] I dunno, it&#8217;s just like a source of pride. It&#8217;s kind of how I got involved. Like I contributed some code to B2 at the time and I just got such a high. From knowing that, you know, hundreds of websites were running my code, and I&#8217;ve just been chasing that ever since. Like it&#8217;s still compelling, even if it&#8217;s a plugin that only like 10 people use to like, you know, obviously any changes the Core go to a lot of the web. At any point it&#8217;s just kinda like leaving a dent in the universe, leaving the world a little bit better than you found it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:10] It&#8217;s funny, you said the word proud, well you said pride and my question contains the word proud, and it is follows. What are the things, and you&#8217;ve covered this a little bit. But this doesn&#8217;t have to be the code, it doesn&#8217;t have to be the community, although maybe that is the bit. What are the bits that you&#8217;re most proud of? The bits that you look back and think I am so pleased that bit happened. And it could be a big thing, could be a tiny thing, but the bit that makes you internally smile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:36] I&#8217;m really proud, to the extent WordPress, it can be a very welcoming place. We really strive to be inclusive, to bring folks from all over the world, all backgrounds. Now I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s mistakes. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s things that happen at WordCamps sometimes, but like we correct that and the norm of the community is expecting to make someone feel welcome. Yeah, I really appreciate that. I mean you look around WordCamp, could not be a more different group of folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:03] Yeah, that&#8217;s true. They&#8217;re an interesting, there&#8217;s an eclectic mix of people up there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:08] Oh my goodness, even it just like fashion styles or like you know, like hairstyles, styles, ages, colors, everything. And how beautiful that? That we can come together with a shared passion, communicate with each other as humans. Every person is unique. You&#8217;re not what it says on your badge or where you work. It&#8217;s really about connecting as humans and that&#8217;s, to me, what&#8217;s great about blogging. It&#8217;s about, what&#8217;s great about the open web. It&#8217;s recognizing the beauty, brilliance and uniqueness of every person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:37] How do you manage your time? Because I know that you&#8217;ve got more things than I&#8217;m doing. Let&#8217;s put it that way. You&#8217;ve got Tumblr, you&#8217;ve got WordPress. Where does it all fit in? Do you like a run a regular week? Are you a 40 hour a week person? Do you tend to work late into the evening or?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:53] I guess there&#8217;s multiple levels to answer that. Where I&#8217;m spending my time in terms of all the projects that are going on, is kinda like rotations. Like often I&#8217;ll move into something, spend a lot of time there and then I&#8217;ll drift back out once, you know, whatever I was coming in for has changed. Probably a good example of that recently was Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:16] So that&#8217;s one took a more active role and kind of release lead, the driving, the getting that happening. Even like the product itself. And then as that really got great you know, 5.1, 5.2, able to step back and allow others to like take a more active role and leading that or driving that. Tumblr&#8217;s is a good example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:38] Like, you know, stepping into it for a bit. I hope to be able to pass it to someone in the future and say like, take this, keep it going. It&#8217;s going great. And so that&#8217;s kind of how the projects do. And then personally, I just try to manage my energy, to match that to the tasks that are happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:53] Unfortunately, I work very strange hours sometimes, and, I just try to capture, like, if I get a burst of inspiration late at night to write something or, feeling really engaged, we&#8217;re in the mood for like doing communication stuff versus like I&#8217;m in the mood for reading, whatever that is, and run with it. Versus trying to say like, every morning I&#8217;m going to do this. Some mornings I&#8217;m tired. Some mornings, you know, maybe I&#8217;m feeling a little more burnt out. And so, like, I don&#8217;t feel that sort of creative spark to, to write a thousand words, but it might be easier to catch up on some P2 posts. Catch up on the Slacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:26] It sounds like you take care of yourself. You take time to step away and, I came in here you were listening to jazz music, which was quite nice sort of background. But, you know, you take time to do all of that. And have you always coped with pressure well, because I&#8217;m guessing there&#8217;s a fair amount of pressure your life, yet you always have this fairly serene composure to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:46] I guess what a lot of people think is pressure doesn&#8217;t bother me very much, because you know, I feel like you should worry about the things you can change. So if you know, we got to note your biggest client is leaving you, they&#8217;ve already made up their mind. You can&#8217;t do anything. It&#8217;s like okay. Like learn from it, but don&#8217;t beat yourself up over it. Like suffer once. Like so often we suffer more, this is a quote, we suffer more in our heads than we do in reality, either for imagined things which is anxiety. Reliving the past, or just kind of beating ourselves up for something. And so it&#8217;s better to just recognize reality. Acknowledge it, learn from it, get as much information as possible, but then what&#8217;s next?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:27] Where it definitely hits me harder is when there&#8217;s something you can&#8217;t change, with a loved one, you know, like someone passing, getting sick, those things hit me really hard. That&#8217;s probably the place where, when that happens, I have to step away for a bit. Just kind of recharge or get in nature, hydrate, make sure I&#8217;m sleeping well. Those things are tough for, I think everyone, but the calmness that happens in normal, like code or business or whatever it is that normally would stress me out. Those are bigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:59] There&#8217;s this phrase, I&#8217;ve written it down here. Benevolent dictator for life. Benevolent is such a nice word. It&#8217;s great. Everybody loves benevolent. Dictator, maybe that&#8217;s a different thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:10] I feel like that branding&#8217;s a little less good recently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:13] But, we all know what that means? Do you plan to be here in several years time? Would you love still to be at the helm of WordPress? Is this going to be the life for Matt Mullenweg for the foreseeable future?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:26] Yeah, three out of those four words are millions to. I hope to be of service to the WordPress community, benevolently. That&#8217;s always something I will do my best. I always say I&#8217;m human. I&#8217;m going to make mistakes. We&#8217;re going to mess up That&#8217;s the only thing I can a hundred percent promise. But we&#8217;ll try to learn from them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:41] Try to course correct and be right more often than not. And then the, for life. Yeah, a hundred percent. Like it&#8217;s been 19 years. I think because WordPress changes so much, I&#8217;m never bored of it. You know, it&#8217;s like one of these things that you know when WordPress launched, javascript was called DHTML. It wasn&#8217;t really common. There was no iPhone. like that. Everything has changed so much and it still is. You know, it&#8217;s hard to imagine looking from 2003 to now, how much things have changed looking forward another 19 years to that would be 2041 or something. Like what will be enabled? And in technology, and don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve seen things like the open AI projects, like GPT3 or DALL-E, like utterly astounding,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:25] I find it a bit scary. Aspects of that worry me. The aspects I think that worry me are the loss of control and that, at some point we&#8217;re going to just be creating 10,000 word articles. So the bot creates the article, which is then read by the Google bot. The cyclical creation of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:44] And also the destabilization of the belief in what your eyes tell you. You know, you see a picture of some famous person allegedly doing something, which they never did, but somebody created it with a click of a button. Those pieces worry me. So you sound much more sanguine about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:59] I&#8217;m pretty excited. The text side is interesting, but I&#8217;m actually really excited by the image creation, not the deep fakes, but more like DALL-E, you can give a prompt. Like I want to see a spaceship cat eating ice cream, while riding a bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:17] That&#8217;s the one everybody&#8217;s going to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:18] And this image has never existed humanity. Yet you can speak your words and it will be created. And it will create like 15 of them. And some of them are weird, but some of them are incredible. And you can say, do it in the style of Salvador Dali, or do it like a Monet painting. Or do it like an illustration. Like that is unlocking that kind of co-creation of art, I find so compelling because that&#8217;s essentially, when technology creates things we can&#8217;t expect that hypercharged creativity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:50] So even when you imagine, when we moved from drumming and using our voices instruments to having, the creation of the first instruments, whether they were stringed instruments, lutes, organs where the most sophisticated technology at a time. Today, the way we can use synthesizers and remix things and multiple tracks. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s certain points, and I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s examples of this creating bad art. You have to make a lot of terrible art to get to the good art.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:13] The boundary comes down, doesn&#8217;t it? You don&#8217;t need to have that dexterity with the pencil or the pen, the paint brush or whatever it is. You have to have the vocabulary to describe it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:22] There&#8217;s an art to that too, like. I feel like there&#8217;s a skill to doing a good Google searches, like crafting the search term in a way that helps you find what you want. And we kind of co-learn with it. There&#8217;s a feedback loop. You put in a search, you don&#8217;t find what you want, and you start to tweak it and you learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:38] I think that the sort of generative art tools like a Dali are the same way. I think Mind Journey is another one. You can go through and feed in some texts and then see what happens. And then like keep going. I mean, how cool would that be. Actually for Tavern, I would love for you to see you all use it more, like, make some, more like Mine Journey or DALL-E type images?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:56] that then leads me to the question about AI creation of websites. So, do you want a future where you build the website with that kind of an interface? So I would like a website that&#8217;s to do with volcanoes and I would like a picture of a volcano at the top. No, not that one. Slightly more fiery. And can we have a button, but no, no red, not blue. Wider. Yeah, no stop there. So that kind of an interface. So we drop the mouse and we describe the website and move the components with our voice, or whatever we&#8217;re using, maybe we&#8217;re plugged point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:28] And how powerful are blocks for that? Right, so we&#8217;re creating the sort of raw ingredients that could be used. I used to not believe this stuff would happen. But it&#8217;s gotten so great. If you&#8217;ve seen Codepilot, Codepilot on Github, or some of the stuff that GPT3 can do around like interface creation or even app creation. It&#8217;s fairly powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:49] We&#8217;re going to have much better machine learning models around translation of languages. I think we&#8217;ll get to a point, you know, we&#8217;ve always joked, like will WordPress ever be written in something other than PHP? I think we&#8217;ll have translators over the next five to 10 years, that could take something as complex as a WordPress and translate the code to another language and it&#8217;ll work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:08] Right, because essentially that&#8217;s, what&#8217;s happening. All these languages go to a bytecode or some sort of something much closer to the wire. So once a computer can truly deeply understand what&#8217;s happening in the code and find the equivalents in another language, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:22] You&#8217;re close to just thinking a website into creation at that point, aren&#8217;t you? The boundary is, can you imagine, and if you can imagine an elucidate it, then you&#8217;ve done it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:32] And think how much creativity has been unlocked by things like Photoshop or Illustrator or the pen for the iPad anything. Like you put these things in front of a child, they just start producing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:42] Oh, immediately. That&#8217;s interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:44] And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s cool, right? And so it kind of comes back to what&#8217;s what&#8217;s the limits of human imagination and a little bit, our limits are what we&#8217;ve experienced so far. So there&#8217;s this idea of adjacent possibilities. That whatever&#8217;s going on in the world, people consume, and then that gives them the ideas for what&#8217;s next. But you need the previous stuff to exist first. Right? We build on the, we stand on the shoulders of giants and every generation that&#8217;s come before. And now with global communication, everything, a cycle of that feedback loop of new things happening and then spreading throughout the culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:19] I mean, used to take hundreds of years. There&#8217;s examples where they knew that scurvy was caused by lack of vitamin C like hundreds of years before it was kind of widely known knowledge. And. You know, they can sequence a novel coronavirus, create the vaccine, literally within like a day, the sequencing being available. What was it, a year and a half later? Like there&#8217;s a billion doses in people&#8217;s arms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:45] The impediment was the testing, not the creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:47] Wow. Even making a billion of something in like a little over a year is kinda wild as well. So that is, think of it both a faster kind of clock speed for the evolution of culture and thought and knowledge that&#8217;s enabled, and also hopefully faster antibodies, both literal and societal to things that can cause harm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:11] You know, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a stretch to think of misinformation, disinformation, you know, sort of the information wars that are happening right now, both hot and cold throughout, um, authoritarian and more democratic regimes as a type of pathogen. Almost like a novel mean virus or idea virus, which right now we&#8217;re not very strong against, but we&#8217;re starting to develop the antibodies too, including things like detecting bots and coordinated inauthentic behavior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:37] That right now I think is causing a lot of problems throughout society. but we&#8217;ll get better at figuring that out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:44] It&#8217;s fascinating because I think technology can take you in one of two directions, you know, the, the apocalyptic version and then the sort of, desirable, let&#8217;s say that. And it feels to me that you are ,firmly on the desirable side. You&#8217;ve got a very positive approach that the technology in the future doesn&#8217;t worry you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:03] It&#8217;s not that it doesn&#8217;t worry me. It&#8217;s just I&#8217;m a builder. So I need to choose that I&#8217;m going to work on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:07] Yeah, sadly, my</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:08] work on the things that things better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:10] My vocabulary left me at that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:12] Techno optimist, maybe. Yes. Like, uh, I would say that I tend towards optimism and the thing that gives me that optimism is often deeply engaging with a criticism of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:23] So I want to really strongly understand, be able to make the argument for why all the things I just talked about are going to destroy society. But then once you understand that, how can we build it or how can we do it in a way that&#8217;s going to be more positive. And also how can we check our assumptions? Like if we look back, to what we thought was going to ruin society before, did it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:43] It&#8217;s funny, there&#8217;s a, gosh, I forget the name of the account, but it just pulls up old criticisms of the technology. And there was one that showed a subway, and everyone&#8217;s, um, reading a newspaper? They&#8217;re like, oh, what&#8217;s happened to society, people used to talk on the subway, they used to engage with each other. Now just the heads are all buried.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:00] Of course Gutenberg, you know, the original, uh, needs to read it&#8217;s, you know, it&#8217;s dangerous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:08] And it turns out that it was dangerous, like wow. Protestant, like, how much change that kicked off, but it was really about knowledge is power. It was about the distribution of a more wider distribution of knowledge and opportunity. And that shook up society. But you know what? I needed to be shooken up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:25] It&#8217;s the message. Maybe this is the perfect point to end?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:27] That&#8217;s what WordPress shakes up, you know? So we take things that, by the way, equivalent to what WordPress does for free, 10 years ago, you&#8217;d pay like millions of dollars a site core or Magento or something like that to do it, which now like you can download WooCommerce and it does everything that did and way more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:45] So we&#8217;re kind of taking, I sometimes make the analogy that we have a promethean task, climb mountain, take the fire from the gods and then bring it to the people. As we do that, sometimes it generates a lot of blow back. You know, if you recall a really big criticism of Gutenberg early on was that it was going to destroy agencies and web builders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:05] People would just be able to build their sites themselves. They would lose all their business, everything like that. As you walk around WordCamp ask anyone who&#8217;s building websites, like, do you have more business or less business? How&#8217;s it going? I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s some exceptions, but by and large, the businesses are larger than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:19] They&#8217;re growing faster. Site builders doing fine, the themes that are like, you know, there&#8217;s going to be some changes, right? Some of us might be making horse buggies, and those might not be as in demand in the future, but you can also like shift and it&#8217;s kind of cool. I have people tell me that they&#8217;re way more profitable now because they can build things in Gutenberg that they used to have to code custom. So even though they could code a custom, they can just click some buttons and build a site and be done so they can now do more of them. How cool is that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:45] So the change definitely disrupts things. It can definitely be sometimes rocky, but ultimately, if you embrace the change and you sort of work from your principles and your morals to be on the right side of history, it can be incredibly empowering. Matt Mullenweg, thank you for talking to me today. Thank you.

It&#8217;s a big part of our business. And I think it&#8217;s like WordPress is a big part of all the hosting company, company’s, businesses, you know? So for us, it is like, we want to make it better. We want to give back. We want to understand, you know, where we can contribute the most. And we see it as a, you know, win, win, win situation for everyone, for clients, for the whole ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for us as a business, of course!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Milana Cap </strong>00:00:32]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite WordPress component is WP CLI. That&#8217;s my crush, haha, because I love terminal. I love doing it. I&#8217;m not a really UI type of person, I get lost in UI. But in terminal, you just type command and it does what you want. And a WP CLI is much more powerful than WordPress dashboard. You can do so many things there and you can have fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, so that&#8217;s my go-to tool!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:10]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello everyone. And welcome to the WordPress Briefing– the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:36]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many, many people were at WordCamp Europe a couple of weeks ago. And at the end, Matt and I closed out the event sessions with a little question and answer time from the community. I was excited to see everyone and excited to answer their questions. But as with all spur of the moment answers, I experienced this <em>l&#8217;esprit de l&#8217;escalier </em>and I found that there were a few things that I would have answered a little more completely if I had taken more than two seconds to think about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So today I&#8217;m going to augment some of the answers from that session with a little more context and clarity. There was a question from Laura Byrne about favorite blocks in recent WordPress releases. And given that I was exclusively holding WordCamp Europe information in my brain at the time, I couldn&#8217;t think of which block was my favorite. While I was sitting there on that stage,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I realized that one of my favorite things about WordPress’s 6.0 release, like Matt, wasn&#8217;t really a block, but it was a functional workflow sort of thing. So my favorite thing was the ability to lock blocks, but I mean, the question was about favorite blocks. And so I do know that some of the most anticipated blocks are the Flexbox layout blocks. Whew. What a sentence!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:46]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to say that three times fast! Those blocks are the Flexbox layout blocks, they are sort of shortcuts that show up when you&#8217;re selecting multiple blocks and allow for easy side-by-side layouts. I&#8217;m not explaining it in a way that does it much justice, but I will share a link in the show notes that has more information and you can kind of see how empowering that particular block is in the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next question I wanted to give a little more context to came from Courtney Robertson. She asked about how to make translated content more readily available on learn.wordpress.org. My answer was pretty far ranging and talked about why it&#8217;s harder to commit to prioritizing that over, for my example, translating WordPress core.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also understand that there are people who want to help and just need someone to point them in the right direction. And so I want to be clear that it is possible to have workshops in any language on learn.wordpress.org right now. We just don&#8217;t have a lot of people contributing those translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are conversations going on right now in the training team about using Glotpress on learn.wordpress.org, and also how to translate subtitles. So, if you are looking for ways to give back through translation and training is an important kind of area of your focus. I will have links to both of those things in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:04:11]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also gave a quick answer, uh, after this question about how hard it is to recognize contributions that are separate from a major event or major release. In this case, when I say recognize, that&#8217;s recognized as in thank, not recognize as in, know it exists. In case it&#8217;s not clear why that was connected, why that answer was connected to the question, training materials are self-serve and not always specific to individual releases of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that means the maintenance of any content around training happens routinely over the course of time, rather than because of a specific release or a WordCamp. What sometimes can make it a little harder to entice people to join us in that work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now the third question I&#8217;d like to tackle is the one that came from Megan Rose. She asked how we can encourage better diversity as we go back to in-person events. My answer was more about the big picture, program-wide work that has been done and specific awarenesses that I, as a leader, have been keeping top of mind. That answer is still true and is still important, but again, it doesn&#8217;t really help anyone who&#8217;s wondering how they can show up today in their own communities, and do the hard work of fostering an inclusive space there so that we can confidently welcome more diverse voices together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:05:27]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A great place to start is to have conversations with people who aren&#8217;t like you and really listen. Also recognizing that we all come from different backgrounds that give us more or less opportunity and always be asking yourself, who is missing from this conversation and why, how can I find them and invite them into our own WordPress spaces?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that all kind of feels right up your alley, I would check out the show notes. I&#8217;ll have some links in there to the community team’s site, as well as a few posts that will help you to explore that a bit further as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were also a couple of questions about market share slash usage of WordPress, and Five for the Future that I really do want to answer, but as I was writing up the context and just kind of exploring the questions that people were raising, it turned out to really be quite a big set of answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I will do those in either two separate episodes of their own or one surprisingly long, for me, episode. And so there you have it, a lightning round, deep dive on a few questions from WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Jonathan Desrosiers </strong>00:06:41]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it&#8217;s definitely great to be back in person. Um, it&#8217;s been a long two years, two or three years for a lot of people and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s great that we&#8217;re such an asynchronous community and we can all stay connected online through Slack and different means. Um, but there are some things that you can&#8217;t replace, like making friends with people and learning people&#8217;s demeanors and having some discussions in person that you can&#8217;t replace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, uh, I&#8217;m really excited to see people I haven&#8217;t seen in a long time. Meet new people and, um, you know, have some of those discussions here today in Portugal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:07:21]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which then brings us to our small list of big things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you missed the announcement, WordCamp Europe will be in Athens next year. And the call for organizers is open already. It&#8217;s an experience that is absolutely irreplaceable. So I&#8217;ll link to that in the show notes, in case you&#8217;ve always wanted to give back to WordPress that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on my list is that work on the next major release of WordPress is already underway. There is a post with roadmap info that was published recently, as well as a slightly more casual thread on Twitter. I&#8217;ve linked both of those in the show notes, so that you have some concept of what it is that we are aiming for in 6.1, and also a concept of where to go to get started working on it if that&#8217;s what you feel like doing, uh, for the next three to four months– 120 days, roughly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and finally. This is less of like a thing to be aware of in the next two weeks and kind of a little WordPress project tool tip. Did you know that we have a calendar that shows all meetings for all teams all week long? It will make you feel tired by the amount of work that gets done in the WordPress project every week, but it&#8217;s right there on make.wordpress.org/meetings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you never have to wonder where folks are meeting to talk about things ever again. And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Santana Inniss &amp; Héctor Prieto </strong>00:09:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello!

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about WordCamp Europe. Gutenberg 13.4 and WordPress 6.1, and a lot of other things. I&#8217;m Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and WordPress developer advocate. And I&#8217;m here with my co-host, Mary Job, WordPress advocate, support engineer at Paid Memberships Pro, and community organizer at wpafrica.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good evening, Mary. How are you today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Oh, I&#8217;m doing absolutely great, Birgit. Thank you for that. Yeah, I&#8217;m doing wonderful. I just recovered from malaria, but I&#8217;m doing great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, wow. Yeah, glad you recovered. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Hi, everyone. I&#8217;m Mary and today I have the honor to present also our special guest tonight. Welcome to Dave Smith, JavaScript engineer, and full-time co contributor on the Gutenberg Project, sponsored by Automattic as part of the Five for the Future program. Thank you so much for joining us tonight, Dave. We&#8217;re happy to have you here, and I&#8217;m sure our listeners are looking forward to listening to you on this episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Well, thank you. And hello Mary and hello Birgit. It&#8217;s a real pleasure to join you here today. I&#8217;m actually a long-time fan of the show. I had a look back at my podcast episodes and I think I&#8217;ve been listening since some of the very earliest, I think. So yeah, it&#8217;s a fantastic resource. In all the time I&#8217;ve been listening, it&#8217;s really helped me keep up-to-date with the latest happenings with the block editor and with WordPress beyond. So yeah, thank you from me for such a great resource, and it&#8217;s a pleasure to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, thank you for these kind words. And I told him to say that. You listeners, you know me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Not at all. Not at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: No, glad to have you, and it&#8217;s going to be a great show with you here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yes, it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: I can already feel it&#8217;s going to be a great show. So before we add into the changelog and the rest of the show, Dave, would you briefly tell us what your WordPress origin story is and what your focus is on the Gutenberg project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, absolutely. Well, I&#8217;ve been working on the web since I think about 2013, although I&#8217;ve started to lose count now. And back in those days, the company I worked for had a proprietary PHP based CMS system, but the thing is, I kept getting asked to do freelance work on the side and I didn&#8217;t have a way to provide my clients with a ability to administer their own sites. And so I found WordPress and that was it, I never looked back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so prior to joining Automattic, I was a technical lead at an agency that was based in Bristol, which is here in the south of the UK, where I live. And we use WordPress on everything, from small business websites to very large enterprise builds as well. In fact, at one point I think myself and a colleague, we even developed a sort of pseudo pattern system using advanced custom fields to allow our clients to sort of make their own pages. So we&#8217;ve really done everything, and it&#8217;s quite cool now to see some of this technology being available natively within the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I joined Automattic four years ago, and during that time I&#8217;ve been consistently involved in the Gutenberg Project. I&#8217;ve contributed to various features, probably the most well known would be the Navigation Block and the link creation user interface. So right now I&#8217;m part of a team that&#8217;s focused on improving the theme authoring and development experience. And as part of that, most recently I&#8217;ve started my own YouTube channel where I&#8217;m posting my firsthand insights into what&#8217;s coming next in the WordPress block editor project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s awesome. It&#8217;s interesting that you also tried to build your own, to work on a CMS and that&#8217;s a proprietary, and I think that&#8217;s what a lot of developers did before they joined WordPress. Interesting. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: It did work out well, that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: I think it was definitely a good move moving to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, definitely. Well, thank you for being here, and that&#8217;s great. So the first part of the announcement was WordCamp Europe, it was absolutely the best. It has been three years, and I was meeting so many friends and made new ones, it&#8217;s a wonderful thing. And I&#8217;m so glad that I actually met you Dave in person for the first time. Did you get home all right? And I know it was your first WordCamp, so what are your takeaways?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, absolutely. It was a real pleasure to meet you finally, Birgit, after so long that we&#8217;ve been unable to do that. But yeah, I had a fantastic time. It was, as you said, my first WordCamp of any kind actually, not just WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah. So for me, it was just really good to see the community in person, in evidence of what amazing community we have, and it was just fantastic to sort of meet all these people for the first time. Yes, I did have some travel disruption from the UK, there was a lot of problems in the UK with getting to Europe at this time. So I did, in fact, miss the contributor day, which I was hoping to go to, which was a shame. But on the other side, I did get there for the main conference and I saw lots of talks and I got to meet lots of contributors. So it was a really, really good experience. And how about you both? I mean, I&#8217;m guessing this wasn&#8217;t the first WordCamp for either of you, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Oh, for me, I wasn&#8217;t at this year&#8217;s WordCamp Europe. I&#8217;ve been trying to get to WordCamp here probably for how long now, but I wasn&#8217;t able to get to it, but definitely not my first WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So you must have felt quite some FOMO fear of missing out when you saw all the tweets coming through and all the pictures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: No, I intentionally didn&#8217;t follow the news because I didn&#8217;t want to cry this time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah and I would&#8217;ve loved to meet you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Another time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. We need to work on the WordCamp Africa there, definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Oh, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yes. I&#8217;ve been getting a lot of people asking about it, but we&#8217;re still working on it. We need to get to know each other in the community for us, that&#8217;s what I always say, and then we can have a WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, because you can&#8217;t do it alone. When I looked at the last pictures that I took for WordCamp Europe, there were about 200 organizers and volunteers, or 250, to make it all happen. And it&#8217;s a huge effort and they planned it all for a year almost. Yeah, Dave, you were right, I haven&#8217;t counted yet, but it was probably my 20th WordCamp also.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Or close to it. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Oh, wow. I want to be like you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, no, you don&#8217;t want to be like me. It&#8217;s hard being me. Yeah, and I was blown away by the community&#8217;s ability to show up. So at contributor today it was the biggest contributor day ever in the history of WordCamps, with over 800 people. And normally they&#8217;re between 200 and 400, but 800 people were really great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And that was the first part, and the other part was that, it was a real hug fest with meeting all the friends we haven&#8217;t seen for three years. It was such a great atmosphere, there was a great energy, everybody was nice and excited. There were also quite a few block editor-related talks and dear listeners you will find links to the times spans of the livestream recording in our weekend edition, number 217.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course we link it in the show notes, but there were a great mix between code examples, high-level strategy and future exploration. And then the workshops were recorded, but not live streamed, so we don&#8217;t have links yet, but they will be uploaded soon to WordPress TV, and we&#8217;ll let you know in a future episode. So Dave, did you get to see any talks at the WordCamp Europe?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, I certainly did. Yeah, I agree with you, there was a really good mix of talks and I thought that was great to see because there was probably something in there for everyone. And I enjoyed listening to a number of them, including one by someone you might know, your excellent ex co-host, Grezgorz, who&#8217;s obviously a colleague of mine at Automattic, but I really enjoyed his talk. But as someone who&#8217;s a full-time contributor to the project, for me, I was just mainly curious to see the sort of topics that folks were interested in having presentations about, and also to sort of listening to the Q&amp;A, because that can often be very revealing as I&#8217;m sure you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: But of all the talks that I saw, I think the one that really stood out to me was the block pattern revolution, which was by Sean Blakely, I think was his name. And in this talk, he covered how his, he works for a very large agency, and in the talk he sort of was just describing how the agency&#8217;s actually using Gutenberg patterns to improve the website creation process as a whole. So it just really resonated with me, because I don&#8217;t know if I said, but worked in agencies for about 10 years prior to joining Automattic, so it&#8217;s a really tough environment to create something, and as you would know, Birgit, of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was just really fascinated to learn how they were using the editor itself as a designer developer collaboration tool. And that was just fascinating to me, that actually using WordPress that as part of the design experience and before that. And one of the tools they did a shout out for was something called the BlockMeister plugin. And what it does is, it gives you a custom post type for patterns, or at least that&#8217;s what I understand. So you can sort of build the patterns themselves within the editor, and they do that sort of collaboratively, not only with the designers and the developers, but also with the client.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the client&#8217;s kind of kept in the loop and they see the design evolving in the browser via WordPress, via patterns. And all of this work helps avoid, what we call in the industry, the big reveal, where the big reveal was always where someone went away and Photoshopped, designed the site and went, &#8220;Ta-da,&#8221; and the client said, &#8220;I hate it, I want the logo bigger,&#8221; that kind of thing. And by doing it in WordPress like that, they avoid that, and I just thought that was fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And doing it in WordPress also adds another layer of experience to it, because it&#8217;s clickable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Kind of people, the client can see what happens when I click on it, and all that. So they also start thinking about that quite a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah. And it&#8217;s super easy to prototype, change those layouts and change things around. So yeah, definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. It was a kind of a complimentary talk to Tammie Lister&#8217;s lightning talk. No, it wasn&#8217;t a lightning talk, it was a full talk on design systems in future WordPress and how to kind of use all the tools, all the units of the block editor to build a design system that can be reused. And I think that was a great example of that, what Sean lately showed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah. And these are topics that have been going around in the web community for a long time, but it&#8217;s just really good that we&#8217;re now seeing the editor as a way to deliver some of these things that have been talked about for so long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: So yeah, and I think it was really inspiring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Excellent. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: But I didn&#8217;t get to make it to any of the workshops, I&#8217;m afraid though. I heard there was a lot of good things about a number of them, but there was one about the block themes by Daisy Olsen, did either of you, well, of course, Birgit, you were there. So did you manage to attend that one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: No. It was fully booked fast, early in the morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I&#8217;m not an early riser, so I didn&#8217;t get in. But I heard great comments about it and it was recorded, and it will be published on the WordPress TV. And there was a lot of people there, I think it was full by 100 people also, it was a really great interest on block themes. And I had some conversations with people about propagating updates of block patterns, and that was kind of an interesting, near the reveal, but that&#8217;s a new word that I learned from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was an interesting aspect of it, that there are quite a few entities like the block patterns, the theme when it was used, when it already was edited by a user and the blocks that are not dynamic blocks, when you change them, you only change them for a new, but never go back to propagate those changes to the former instances of patterns or blocks or even a theme. Because if a user touched it, the new design on the template part or template will not come into that install when you update the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for that part, I know you could always do an additional block part, a block pattern and make that an upgrade. But it&#8217;s interesting that some of the mechanisms that worked before are hard to come by now. So I&#8217;m sure that we will kind of see some updates there and discussions in the community even more, but that was kind of what came out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: I definitely hear the conversation around block patterns, particularly, and there&#8217;s a desire somewhere there, I think to be able to have a central source of truth for block patterns, and be able to put them into lots of different posts, but then come back and be able to say, &#8220;Oh, I want to change the border color and add this block,&#8221; and have that propagate to all the previous instances of patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: But of course, as you know, patterns are supposed to be a one-time thing. Once they&#8217;re in the editor, that&#8217;s it, they&#8217;re not tied back to anything, they&#8217;re just blocks again. So it&#8217;s not something we can do now, but it seems to be something that people want. So whether this is a workflow thing that we just need to do better at describing to people how the different options they got, or whether this is a new sort of, a new desire for a whole new paradigm of something that&#8217;s sort of halfway between a reusable block and a pattern and a template part. It&#8217;s all a bit muddy at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And the reusable block actually does that. So if you change a reusable block, it propagates the other instances. So I think that, I don&#8217;t know if that can be duplicated or maybe the transformation API can help with that, but these are all conversations for GitHub. And later on, speaking of what&#8217;s next for WordPress Gutenberg Phase 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for the keynote, there was the AMA town old style, interact with Matt Mullenweg at the end of WordCamp Europe. Matias Ventura was supposed to be on stage, he couldn&#8217;t make it, but he had prepared a few things. But what also happened was that day, he also published the roadmap for 6.1 for the Gutenberg Phase 2, which is the customization part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Ventura, he wrote the tune of the release will be to refine the experiences introduced, 5.9 and 6.0, weave the various flows into more coherent and fulfilling experiences for users, maintainers and extenders and close some gaps in functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we start to look towards Phase 3 of the Gutenberg roadmap, Phase 3, just as a note, that was the end of the quote. But Phase 3 for Gutenberg is collaborative editing, like Google style collaborative editing. So Dave, you created a short video introducing your top five features, you are excited about coming to WordPress 6.1, what were they?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, I did. And it&#8217;s on my channel, which will be in the show notes. But I based my video largely around the GitHub tracking issue that Matias has been updating after WordPress 6.0 was launched. And obviously now he&#8217;s come out and subsequently posted the high-level overview on make blog. But the video just aims to be a really quick and easily digestible overview of everything that&#8217;s sort of planned for 6.1, for anyone who wants to get up to speed quickly and what&#8217;s coming next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s not really canonical, I think Matias has posted it as the place you want to look, that said, I mean, my video does seem to sync with what Matias said quite well, which is mainly there&#8217;s site editing and template changes. There&#8217;s going to be a lot of focus on patterns. There&#8217;s going to be upgrades to the whole styling, the way we deal with styling and editor, and then obviously upgrades to key blocks like nav block and comments block. And then we&#8217;ve also got theming improvements coming. And we can talk about those in a little bit more detail if you&#8217;d like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well, talking about the template editor, there are a few more additional stages there, like a browse stage or a view of that is to come. And then the unifying kind of, like you can zoom out of a template and see the full page, and then you can zoom in again to make those changes. And one goal is also to provide more clarity. And that&#8217;s definitely good news for the community and the theme developers, more clarity between the global elements like templates, template parts and styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And then the improvement of navigation block that had a few iterations and could do some more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, the navigation block is a really tough one, and that&#8217;s definitely due some work in this release. I mean, some of the key things for me having worked on it is the ability to carry menus when you&#8217;re switching themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dave Smith: And also, there needs to be an improved integration with global styles. And then a lot of people have been asking for things like, &#8220;Can we use different menus on different screen sizes?&#8221; We may be able to look into that. But one of the interesting things that Matias highlighted in his post was the effort that&#8217;s currently actually underway. And we have a prototype already in the plugin, which you may have come across, but to have a way to show the navigation structure outside of the navigation block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So at the moment in the Gutenberg editor, there&#8217;s a prototype of a sidebar that will come in and you can manage the structure, the data of your navigation, and that&#8217;s kind of separate from the block, which if you think about the block, it also ties together visual aspects as well, so that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;m definitely going to be focused on as part of my work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: And in terms of patterns, we&#8217;ve got the aerial view, which is, I don&#8217;t know if anyone&#8217;s seen this yet, but it&#8217;s like a zoomed out view of the editor canvas, and that&#8217;s going to be really exciting because it means we&#8217;ll be able to think about patterns more as sections of a website. And instead of having to deal with all the sort of low level, fine grain blocks and it can get a bit confusing and too many options, we might be able to give our clients a, &#8220;Go into this section editor view, and you&#8217;ll be able to just pick the block patterns and quickly build out a site.&#8221; And it sort of resonates quite well again with what we are discussing from the talk by Sean earlier, then you can imagine how those two things would play together very, very nicely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mm-hmm. Yeah. And I see that Matias Ventura also mentioned that managing safe patterns would also be part of the roadmap or at least the goal is on it. So that kind of probably comes back to the discussion about safe patterns and kind of get back to it when you transform it and also kind of maybe even propagated through the updates through that. Mary, do you see anything in there that excites you for 6.1 that you want to talk about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Oh, for me, I think it&#8217;ll be the patterns. I&#8217;m liking the fact that people can actually contribute patterns. Like you literally have, you don&#8217;t need to be a programmer to contribute to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s really, really important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Pen and directory. Yeah, it&#8217;s open for submissions. Yes. Yeah, it&#8217;s awesome. And there are probably, I saw a number, like 10,000 patterns that are in the directory, but they are also translated in multiple languages. So it could be a thousand translated into 10 languages, so that made quite a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: So-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So&#8230; Yeah, go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: No, I was going to say, it might seem like a small feature, but I think it&#8217;s going to make WordPress more accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: For sure. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: More accessible to more people in far corners of the globe, because then literally it means that you don&#8217;t have to be actively into the ecosystem for you to be able to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: For sure. Yeah. Good point. So what else is in the 6.1? Yeah, we have this great discussion about responsive and intrinsic design, where I see some people in the community kind of missing the view points, kind of the break points for the tablet, mobile and desktop view. And I think there are some philosophy, or there&#8217;s the more modern way to do it is with intrinsic design, because all the break points are pretty arbitrary and you have different sizes even beyond those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it also has to do with the components because you can use a column or a cover block over the full website or width of the website, or you can put it into a column, in a two-column website, and it still needs to behave and be adapted to it. So I think the same with the fluid typography system and managing web fonts that is in the works. And so we&#8217;ll see quite a few things changing here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Definitely. I think we&#8217;ve seen with the way CSS works and it&#8217;s evolved towards things like using CSS grid for layout. I mean, that&#8217;s intrinsic by nature, we don&#8217;t have to give all the individual break points and say, &#8220;At this size, you should do this, at this size you should do that,&#8221; you just tell the algorithm how you want it to behave, and it just does the layout for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: And I think it&#8217;s been something that, as you say, people have been asking for media queries in Gutenberg for some time, but if we can avoid having to do that, for the majority of users it&#8217;s going to provide a much better experience, because whilst we are all intimately familiar with media queries and having to change break points, the majority of our users are not going to be, and nor would they want to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we want it to be so it just works, I&#8217;ll be interested to see how far we can take that, I mean, whether at some point we&#8217;ll end up having a medic, a break point interface in Gutenberg is a bigger question that I&#8217;m not qualified to answer, but it certainly will be interesting. But you mentioned fluid typography, I mean, we&#8217;ve already got, I&#8217;ve seen a PR for that very recently, and so that is on the way, I mean, we&#8217;re going to have this system where the font size will adapt appropriately based on the size of your view port, and it&#8217;s a hot topic the in CSS world right now, and bringing it already into the editors is a big win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mm-hmm. Yeah. And I think the page fillers that have been in business for five to seven years, there wasn&#8217;t anything about intrinsic design available, it was just the way to adapt to different screen sizes was through media queries. I think Jen Simmons, who kind of coined the word, intrinsic design, only talked about it since 2019 or something like that, or &#8217;18, but it&#8217;s already four years old. I always think that the two years of COVID, it&#8217;s kind of half a year, but it has been two years. I&#8217;m kind of getting my history a little bit bogged down. Yeah. A sense of time is skewed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: It feels like it was for four years or five.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. At one point it&#8217;s just yesterday and then one point it&#8217;s five years. Yeah. Yeah, and the last part or sections that Matias Ventura mentioned was the theming improvements with a theme building plugin that&#8217;s in the works and will come to the repo pretty soon, to the WordPress plugins repo. So you could export it or you can create a new block theme, or you can have all the user settings that you put into the theme exported to have it in the theme. So it sounds like a really good plugin to come and then also have templates and parts put between themes. Yeah, that&#8217;s another paradigm shift a little bit, it kind of makes it interesting. Yeah, it&#8217;s not only the template parts of&#8230; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah. Well, if you&#8217;re working on a template or a part, you&#8217;ve crafted that in one theme and there&#8217;s no reason why you wouldn&#8217;t expect that to be taken over to a new theme if you switch. And I think that&#8217;s really the goal is to make the content, not so tightly coupled to your theme, and we&#8217;ve already sort of broken the design away from the theme to some extent, and it&#8217;s just that doing the same with the content and templates and parts is definitely a goal that we should be looking to achieve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And that&#8217;s where also it comes in, that blocks are separate from the theme. Yeah, because if you have a site title tag, it doesn&#8217;t matter what the header is, if the site title block is in it, it will show up right, and that&#8217;s really great. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, absolutely. I&#8217;m also looking forward to the comments form block coming, maybe in 6.1, because we&#8217;ve had the comments query loop land in 6.0. But I think the form is still using a Pitch P server side rendering, there&#8217;s like a legacy form of the block, an initial form of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: But to have a fully block based comments form block is going to be quite something, I think. It&#8217;s my understanding of it, I&#8217;ve been speaking to some of the people working on it, is that it&#8217;s pretty complex to realize, but if we do realize it&#8217;s going to be a bit like the navigation block in that it will provide a lot of knock-on benefits to the wider block ecosystem. So I&#8217;m excited to see how that develops in this release cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it also could be kind of a prototype on how forms handling can be done in block fashion. So yeah, it&#8217;s definitely something to look forward to. And one of the goals for the 6.1 is also to allow for gradual adoption of the full-site editing features and see if one or other features can be modified to be available for the classic themes. For instance, calling a full-site editing template part and headers and footers, but the rest of it is still a classic theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I saw a few PRs there, it was also the conversation that, so Matias was on the show after he published a roadmap for 6.0, and in that conversation, he also talked about that FSE or block themes, not necessarily need to replace classic themes, it just adds a few layers of user interactions that can be switched on and off with the block locking features and theme JSON, for the theme builder. But it enhances actually classic themes, and they can all be used side by side, and it&#8217;s just an evolving of the whole template, and then the interaction with the global styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And maybe we can get that to be a little bit more cohesive with the classic themes and not have that. Our language is like, there is a break, there&#8217;s going to be a break one time we do that, and then the next time we are doing something totally different, and the old one is not good anymore, which isn&#8217;t the case because it&#8217;s all WordPress and it&#8217;s all feasible. And why should a theme developer need to change if the market doesn&#8217;t really value that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So I think we need to really be conscious about that. We are not kind of before and after, and as well as kind of put it together with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: I like the way Matias thinks about these things, because I know that there&#8217;s been quite a few people exploring sort of hybrid or universal themes where I think my colleague, Ben Dwyer posted on ThemeShaper blog, which is a blog all about, surprisingly, about theming. And he had a couple of explorations where they were sort of, it was like a halfway house between a classic theme, but it was also consuming blocks in a different way, and I think that&#8217;s a really healthy way of thinking about things rather than this sort of hard dividing line. You either are on the classic theme or you&#8217;re on a block theme, it&#8217;s like there is a middle ground there somewhere for people to explore, and I think that&#8217;s really healthy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: I think it&#8217;s really good for the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, and WordPress has the promise of the backwards compatibility, everything that the classic themes do is in rapid score and it will stay there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I haven&#8217;t seen any talk or any effort at all yet to kind of make that obsolete or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s just, I know it&#8217;s a fear in the community, but I think there&#8217;s just, trust the system. You trusted it before the last 19 years there, now we go into the next 25 years or so. So yeah, all right, that&#8217;s all about the philosophies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So for community contributions, I only have two things in there. So Lottie has created an official plugin for the WordPress repository to bring animations to the block editor and the interface to control the settings for the animation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s a single block plugin, and this is really cool, if you are not a fan of gradients and if you&#8217;re not a fan of dual tone, you&#8217;re probably also not a fan of animations, but for those who play around with all of the things, it&#8217;s really cool that you have additional interfaces there and additional interaction pretty much. So WordPress Tavern has an article about it, and we also shared it of course, in the show notes, and there are other plugins who offer that, but this is the official LottieFiles plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so if you are into that and want this to offer some of your client site, check it out. All right. And the second thing that I wanted to let our users know, or our listeners know, we just scheduled the next Gutenberg Times live Q&amp;A. We haven&#8217;t had one for quite a while, I think the last one was in October, and the title is, Blocked First Approach, at the Pew Research Center, using a mixture of core and custom blocks for a streamlined publishing process, and to create powerful charge and quizzes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Guests will be Seth Rubenstein, the lead developer of Pew Research website and Michael Piccorossi, who&#8217;s the head of digital, it&#8217;s the content creators. And right now I only have save-the-date, it&#8217;s July 22nd 2022 at 11 Eastern Daylight 1500 UTC. And it was inspired by this Twitter thread that he started out with saying for all its naysayers, &#8220;Gutenberg is a game changer for digital news apps. It&#8217;s a force multiplier for your team, we&#8217;ve spent the last three years going all in on block development.&#8221; And then he followed up with a thread that we definitely will discuss in that show. So save-the-date, July 22nd 11:00 AM Eastern 1500 UTC.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Moving on to what&#8217;s released, this brings us to the latest Gutenberg plugin release, 13.4 246 contributors match PRs for this release and among them are five new contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yay, five new contributors. Excellent. Congratulations. Yeah, so there are quite a few enhancements in this release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We have, one is, the gallery block now has an opt-in axial block spacing control. So you can control separately the columns, gata, as well as the rogue gata. So you can have interesting layouts for your gallery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is really great, I saw some of the designs that are in the PR, it&#8217;s 41175. Yeah, it&#8217;s definitely great. Another enhancement is that the search block has now the ability to specify additional search query variables, so you can add additional parameters to the URL and share that, so that is like a post type product, or a post type book or any of the other variables there, it could be a date, it could be a category as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s really powerful that, especially if you&#8217;re using WooCommerce or another eCommerce system, like to be able to just say to the search block, &#8220;I want to search my products.&#8221; That&#8217;s definitely something that&#8217;s been missing for quite a while, so I was pleased to see that land.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mm-hmm. Yeah, definitely. Another one is that a color picker finally strips out the hash sign from the pasted hex values, when you come in from a color style guide or something like that, and you just want to add the color to a block entity and you didn&#8217;t know if you use the hash or not the hash, and it now strips out the hash and you don&#8217;t have to worry about it anymore. There were also some design updates to the published pop over time, daytime picker, so that&#8217;s definitely also a quality of life kind of change. It&#8217;s a bit better to navigate that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, we&#8217;ve seen a number of upgrades to that in recent times. It&#8217;s getting better and better. I definitely appreciate Rob&#8217;s work on this one, especially, he&#8217;s been looking really hard at sort of making it work in different scripts and different languages, which is obviously really important because we don&#8217;t all speak English.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well actually the majority of installations are not in English, so definitely a good….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Important work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Totally. Yeah. And all the people that use WordPress actually benefit from that quite a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, I was also interested in another one, another PR that came, landed in this release, which was the adding support for button elements to theme JSON. So this is something that&#8217;s part of a wider effort that&#8217;s really to allow themes to better target specific HTML elements within blocks, without requiring custom CSS. So currently you can kind of say, &#8220;Within the editor globally or within this block, I want to target all link elements or H3 elements, or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I want to make them a certain color, or I want to add certain spacing.&#8221; But it&#8217;s fairly limited. And so there&#8217;s an effort underway to sort of expand that range of elements that you&#8217;ll be able to target. And the real key here is it&#8217;s going to be able to sort of reduce the amount of sort of specificity wars that we have with CSS, where we&#8217;re trying to overload core styles with custom CSS, if you&#8217;re looking to extend your block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: The best thing about this feature is I can see is that it&#8217;s actually going to allow these elements to be exposed by global styles, so if you&#8217;re going to the global styles UI as a normal user and be able to say, &#8220;I want all my links to be this color,&#8221; or &#8220;I want all my links within the paragraph block to be slightly another color,&#8221; or &#8220;I want to have an underline,&#8221; or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s really powerful because it means we&#8217;re removing the need for our users to have to understand CSS, which has always been a problem, and we still hear that, &#8220;Please we need the custom CSS field back in the editor.&#8221; But by moving these things and inter-theme JSON, we do allow this to be exposed in a much more intuitive way via UI, so that&#8217;s an important thing to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if we think about into the future, we&#8217;re going to have this rolled out towards all sorts of form elements. So imagine you can say, &#8220;Oh, I want all input type elements, including sort of text areas and things like that to have this color border,&#8221; and you can just do that in one go, without having to know all the relatively complex CSX CSS selectors that you&#8217;d need to know to target all form elements. And if you&#8217;ve ever tried to style a form using CSS, you know exactly what I&#8217;m talking about, it&#8217;s not the simplest of things after this many years of CSS, it&#8217;s still quite tricky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s still quite tricky, yes that&#8217;s true. And there are quite a few PRs that support those button elements in theme JSON, like also the fire blocks and the search blocks have a button that now is an element button, so it follow that design that you will have in theme JSON as well. And also in the post comments, the buttons there as well. So I think the buttons are moving forward with that and that informs on the designers and developers on how well it&#8217;s going.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>APIs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And if there is some need for adjustments there, how to do that. And then we had a few, for developers there&#8217;s a new API available now that moves the visible block state into the block editor store, so that means that anybody who can tap into the store API can see if a block is visible or not, so you have some conditional handling in any of the, be it a plugin or in additional blocks. So that is definitely an improvement for extensibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, absolutely. And as we move forward with patterns, I think that&#8217;s going to be important because we&#8217;re going to be able to detect whether the block is actually currently shown on the current screen, like it might be off the screen, it might be below the scroll fold, so that&#8217;s going to be an important thing, previously it was sort of hidden in the react context and you couldn&#8217;t get a hold of it, but now they&#8217;re exposing it, and I think it&#8217;s part of the work to do what we talked about earlier with this sort of aerial exploded view of the block patterns, the sort of blocks as sections that Matias has mentioned in this post, so this is work towards that roadmap already?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. We also had some three PRs that are very influential on the performance of the websites or the block editor, and one is that the auto completer performance is improved. And then also the external library react spring was upgraded, actually two versions, two full versions from 2.4 to 4.5, and it&#8217;s a better handling of the downtime of the block editor. Before it was always something kind of pinging something in the background and it was slowing down the block editor, and now that has been fixed and react spring and now it comes to the block editor as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the biggest part is that CSS is conditionally loaded per block, so if a block is not on canvas, it will not load the CSS, or on the front end, if it&#8217;s not used, it will also not load the CSS into the file when it&#8217;s rendered. So those are great improvements. We have not seen a make blog yet, I think it&#8217;s coming out tomorrow or later today where also the performance numbers are going to be published, but I think we&#8217;re going to see some improvements there. And I had one other thing, did I jump over some of it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for the developers who are using the create block script, there have been some improvements to the block templates. One is about the dynamic blocks and then also additional template variables in there to make sure that it fixes some of the issues that people run into. And it also remove the wrapping of the diff, so there are no usability issue anymore on, what was it? The edit JSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what else? Create block always gets some nice additional features to improve the developer experience. We&#8217;re starting out with block development, so I love to highlight that in this changelog that&#8217;s kind of taken over from Grzegorz who is working on it. I really appreciate the work on that because I learned quite a bit through that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, that script is a big time saver. If you ever want to create a block and it&#8217;s gone through so many iterations in the past year, it&#8217;s come on leaps and bounds and anyone who creates a block today should be very thankful to the likes of Grzegorz and other people have been working on that consistently. It&#8217;s a great tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Ryan Welcher has also been working on that quite a bit because he uses it every time he does a live twitch stream, he starts out with a create block command line. And he also found, &#8220;Okay, if I want to do a dynamic block, I need a different template. If I want to do instead of a single block plugin, I want to do a multi block plugin, what does the template need to change?&#8221; And he was very instrumental to get those two templates into the grade block and then also talked about it on his twitch theme. So if you ever, I could share some of his videos also on YouTube, in the show notes. So if you wanted to get started, I think it&#8217;s a great way to see how that&#8217;s going to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, that sounds really good. I was using it to extend a block recently. I wonder if there&#8217;s a template for that, that&#8217;d be interesting to see. So yeah, I&#8217;ll look out for those show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Another thing that went into this release was the navigation editor screen has been removed from the experiments page. As I did this PI I&#8217;ve had quite a few questions about it, So I just wanted to talk briefly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: And just to clarify, it&#8217;s not necessarily a formal deprecation of the navigation editor screen or the project, but what we were finding is that with the run up to 6.0, and that there weren&#8217;t any contributors who were actively working on that screen, but we still kept getting quite a few bug reports saying it no longer works with the new navigation block entity system, and this thing is out-of-date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we took the decision, that rather than confusing contributors or people are coming to the Gutenberg plugin, we would just hide it for now, and therefore we wouldn&#8217;t have so many bug reports from people spending time in basing those when they didn&#8217;t need to. But it is something that we will, no doubt, utilize some of the technology for, to build things like exposing the navigation structure in the sidebar, which we talked about earlier on. So no doubt it will be harvested for all useful things that happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mary, is there anything that you wanted to point out from that changelog that we kind of skipped over it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay. Yeah. Tell me, Dave, about the switch over from Puppeteer to Playwright in the testing suite. What&#8217;s the nature of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, absolutely. Well, our fellow contributor, Kai Hai, and also Isabelle Brison, they&#8217;ve both been working quite a while now on migrating these tests to a new system called Playwright, away from the existing system called Puppeteer. For those who don&#8217;t know, what we&#8217;re talking about is that Gutenberg has a set of automated tests, which run in a real browser and run against a real WordPress install, but everything&#8217;s kind of thrown away, so it doesn&#8217;t necessarily start if the tests are run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s just asserting that the way the software behaves is correct, and it gives you confidence when you&#8217;re doing release that you haven&#8217;t broken everything. I mean, obviously it can&#8217;t catch every single bug, but it definitely helps to improve things. But what we&#8217;ve been finding is that the software that&#8217;s been underused is called Puppeteer, that controls these tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we are finding there&#8217;s been a lot of what we call, flaky tests, and these are actually automatically flagged up now in the repo that if a test fails several times, it&#8217;s marked as flaky and then someone&#8217;s supposed to come and deal with it, but they&#8217;ve been building up and building up and there&#8217;s been more and more of them. And Kai actually looked into seeing if there&#8217;s other systems that could help us offer more stable tests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in fact, he concluded and he wrote on make blog at length about moving over to this new system called, Playwright. It&#8217;s much better maintained, there&#8217;s a lot more people working on it, it offers better debugging. But also I think most interestingly it encourages testing of the actual interface that our users experience rather than, there&#8217;s a temptation when you&#8217;re writing these tests to sort of say, &#8220;Get me this element by class name or a ID,&#8221; and then do something with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But of course, normal users can&#8217;t see class names or IDs, so you&#8217;re kind of circumventing, the tests aren&#8217;t testing the real software. So with Playwright, it makes it a lot easier, let&#8217;s say, to test in a way that is more akin to our users. And in the future, we may also be able to test on other browsers. Currently we can only test on Chromium, but we may also in the future be able to run these tests against the likes of Firefox and Safari.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And hopefully these tests will become faster, more stable and more reliable as a result of this. So I think it&#8217;s really good work and Kai and Isabelle are making good headway on it, and I&#8217;d encourage anyone who&#8217;s looking to contribute and who&#8217;s got experience of testing to come and help them with their effort, because they&#8217;ve got a lot of tests to migrate, but yes, it&#8217;s a very worthwhile project, in my opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah, no, it really sounds like it. Well, I&#8217;m always kind of thinking about who else can use that, is that recommended for plugin developers who built their own custom blocks to also kind of look into the testing suite, the Playwright and kind of reuse some of those tests for their own purpose?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah. Well, I can&#8217;t say that I personally have done that yet and explored that, but I know that the software itself is designed to be used in any context. I can&#8217;t see why there would be a reason why you couldn&#8217;t do that. I mean, again, it&#8217;s going to be the same process, which is you&#8217;re going to spin up a WordPress install. You&#8217;re going to activate your block plugin and then you are going to create a post, put your block into the post and then interact with it programmatically to determine if it works. So I would imagine that there&#8217;ll be things that we can do to reuse some of the technology we&#8217;ve got in Gutenberg when you&#8217;re building a custom block, so I&#8217;ll be interested to hear if anyone&#8217;s explored that already, and yeah, please do reach out to me or Kai, or Isabelle to discuss that, as I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;d be very interested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome. Awesome. All right. I think that concludes our changelog of 13.4. It has a few quality of life things, great enhancements for some of the pieces and then also for developers. So yeah, test it out. It&#8217;s now available in the repo, and that brings us to the section of what&#8217;s an active development or discuss and needs some input.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you had something that you wanted to talk about, like the ability to control interactivity states in the editor, that, that&#8217;s in the works, and I saw that, is that the java state or the visited state or what else, do you talk about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, absolutely. Well, you&#8217;ve covered it pretty well there. I mean, there&#8217;s been a request for quite a while to be able to change the way that things look based on how you interact with an element. I think probably the classic example is if you&#8217;ve got a navigation menu, and sometimes when you hover over one of the items in that menu, it changes visually, doesn&#8217;t it, perhaps the color changes or there&#8217;s a background or there&#8217;s an underlying, and that isn&#8217;t possible currently in the editor, which is obviously quite a big failing at the moment and something we need to address.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s work underway to allow the ability to target these things, and it&#8217;s actually a much more complex thing than you&#8217;d imagine to achieve in a robust manner, because we need to consider things like, it should be only limited to specific elements and specific properties because it&#8217;s not good to have, if you&#8217;re rolling over a heading, you don&#8217;t want that suddenly changing link color, I mean that would be a very bad thing for accessibility, for some people that will really throw them off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it should only be things like anchors and things that you can interact with or focus. So we&#8217;re going to be starting rolling this out. It&#8217;s going to be, starting with a technical implementation first, so it&#8217;ll land first in theme JSON, so developers will be able to take use of it. But ultimately, it will be rolled out to the global sales interface. So in the future one day, hopefully by 6.1, we will see, you might be able to go into your navigation block, set the color of the text to be blue, for example, but then say, &#8220;Oh, but when the text is hovered or your mouse rolls over it, I want it to go to yellow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if someone focuses it with a keyboard, I want to have a blue underline underneath it.&#8221; And you&#8217;ll be able to do that all through the editor. So again, another way that we&#8217;re removing the need for users to necessarily to understand the ins and outs of CSS, pseudo selectors and things like that. So yeah, a shout out to Andre Draganescu for his work on this feature. And if you want to follow up, it&#8217;s Gutenberg issue number 38277.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes. And of course we will have the link to that issue in the show notes. Now does it also cover in the navigation bar when I am on the page, does it also trigger the active kind of state of&#8230; So I&#8217;m on my about page, does that about page, is there a possibility to give that a different color when I&#8217;m on the about page, so kind of help with the navigation and kind of&#8230; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah. So there is an active pseudo selector in CSS that we could include in this and that might help a bit, but I think in terms of styling something based on what page you are on, if it&#8217;s the current page, for example, then I think there is a known bug again that, that is something that we&#8217;d need to add programmatically in CSS and in PHP to determine, are you on that page and which nav item represents that page and then add the appropriate class name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s kind of two ways that could be tackled. But I mean, ultimately it should be open to any CSS, pseudo selector, but just probably on a limited number of elements, and we&#8217;ve got to liaise with the community and especially the accessibility team to determine what is the most appropriate. So there&#8217;s some really, really good designs that are already out in the wild about this, on that issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I definitely encourage people to check that out because it shows how the interactions will work, and if you think there should be certain things that it&#8217;s able to do or it&#8217;s not able to do then now is the time to input because it&#8217;s under active development right now and being designed as we speak, so it&#8217;d be great to hear from people if they&#8217;ve got thoughts on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. And then I think I mentioned it briefly before. So in the Gutenberg Times weekend edition of 215, I listed three block theme JSON generator or theme generators. And now we have a fourth one to come that&#8217;s the great block theme plugin that will be&#8230; We have a link in the show notes to the getup repo, but it will be a community plugin. What do you know more about it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, this is a plugin that&#8217;s kind of spun out of work that my team would be doing. I mentioned earlier that we&#8217;ve been working on improving the developer and theme or theme authoring experience. And what we found is that there are some things we wanted to do that aren&#8217;t necessarily that appropriate to land in court, it could add additional complexity that everyday users don&#8217;t want to have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the much requested feature, which is when you are editing templates in the site editor people often say, &#8220;I want those changes to be persisted back to the file system as pattern files or template part files,&#8221; sorry, &#8220;Templates or template part files.&#8221; But for a normal user, that&#8217;s not something that you&#8217;d probably want to do, but if you&#8217;re creating a theme from scratch, it very much is. So what has been born out of this is this create block theme plugin, create block theme, being the operative word there, theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: And it used to be owned by Automattic, but we decided that it was something that would be beneficial to the wider community. So it&#8217;s now been open sourced and it&#8217;s now the property of the WordPress project. And it&#8217;s very much targeted at theme builders. So if you&#8217;re someone who wants to create a theme from scratch, then this plugin is likely to be something you want to at least take a look at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as I said, things like saving to file system and giving you extra export controls are there, it&#8217;s far from perfect at this point, and I mean, a lot of it has to be accessed from its own dedicated setting screen. It&#8217;s not fully integrated with the editor much as we would like, but it&#8217;s definitely showing promise, and we&#8217;re hoping that it&#8217;ll become the sort of, almost like a standard plugin for the WordPress ecosystem for crafting block themes from scratch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And I like that it also offers a possibility to create a child theme of the current activity theme, and that you can also clone themes. So it&#8217;s quite powerful in the idea and has already quite a few options in there. And you install it on your site, right, if I understand that correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And then you have an additional menu item under appearance with a new page that&#8217;s called, create block theme, and then you have all the options that are in there, like set up, style, customization, templates and the save part. And of course you can always use the export theme from the site editor or from the plugin to download the theme. So it&#8217;s quite an interesting plugin and I know that the community has been waiting for that. All right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, this is the end of the show. It&#8217;s marvelous. And thank you very much for your great contributions here, Dave, you&#8217;ve given us a lot of insights into the background of some of the features and some of the work. So I want to remind everyone again on save-the-date of July 22nd, 11:00 AM Eastern to 1500 UTC with a live Q&amp;A, with the Pew Research Team who builds sites with a block editor, first approach. Also, Dave, when people want to connect with you, how can they find you, and what&#8217;s the URL of your YouTube channel?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Dave Smith</em>: Yeah, absolutely. So I usually appear as, getdave or sometimes get_dave on various websites around the internet. And if you want to get in touch with me, you can find me on WordPress Slack. But also be sure to check out my YouTube channel and you can access that with a link that&#8217;s going to be published in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Fabulous. So, Mary, do you have anything that you didn&#8217;t get in before? So now is your chance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: No, I think we covered everything we wanted to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. How can people reach you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mary Job</em>: Oh, me, I&#8217;m maryjob on Twitter. I like spending my time on the streets of Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. And as always, the show notes will be published on gutenbergtimes.com for this podcast. This is episode 68, and if you have questions or suggestions or news you want us to include, send them to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>.

Remkus de Vries, one of the founders of WCEU, joined our recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/29-remkus-de-vries-on-how-wordcamp-europe-got-started\">WP Jukebox podcast</a> and commented on the importance of being back in person with fellow WordPress enthusiasts. He characterized WordCamps as the &#8220;glue&#8221; that keeps the community together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think the glue part is way more important than people thought that it was,&#8221; de Vries said. &#8220;I think you can say the same thing for what we’re seeing here. Yes, you can be connected. You can have great relationships online and everything, but the real deal is in real life. That’s where you make the actual connections. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You have things you say that you then in real life have time to correct if that wasn’t the intent that you actually had. All of these little things make up what that glue actually consists of, so not having that for two years creates a like a vacuum of things that are not seen, not communicated, not spoken about, not processed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There have been companies started from WordCamps. There have been mergers started. There have been friends made there have been marriages come from WordCamps.

In the Q&amp;A following his <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2021-wordpress-passes-43-market-share-looks-to-expand-the-commons-through-openverse\">2021 State of the Word</a> address, he said, &#8220;Gutenberg is something even bigger than WordPress, which is basically saying how do we edit and create the web? And how can we get as many people, both proprietary and open source collaborating on that as possible?&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making Gutenberg available to the broader web was part of the reasoning behind <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/proposal-and-steps-to-dual-license-gutenberg-under-the-gpl-and-mpl\">dual-licensing the project</a> under the GPL and MIT. Proprietary, and particularly mobile application use (where the GPL is not common), is better supported by the MIT license. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg is already finding a destiny of its own outside of WordPress. Projects like <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/gutenberg\">Drupal Gutenberg</a> and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/laraberg-a-gutenberg-implementation-for-laravel-is-now-in-beta\">Laraberg</a> were some the early seeds of the wider Gutenberg ecosystem, demonstrating that communities other than WordPress find value in the project and can adapt it for use with their applications. At WordCamp Europe, Mullenweg announced that both <a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/\">Tumblr</a> and <a href=\"https://dayoneapp.com/\">Day One</a> are now testing Gutenberg in their web apps. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Day One web, currently in internal alpha, is following soon.

It&#8217;s opt-in for now while it&#8217;s still being tested. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Activating the beta unlocks the new Gutenberg-powered editor with redesigned buttons and icons. Users can post a series of multiple blocks in what feels like a mini, pared-back post editor. Certain blocks can be dragged and dropped into a different order on the draft, but this is still a little buggy. Tumblr&#8217;s editor is fun to use compared to WordPress&#8217; version of Gutenberg which does a lot more but at the expense of having to support many more settings and controls. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>When <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-tumblr-plans-to-rebuild-the-backend-powered-by-wordpress\">Automattic acquired Tumblr</a> in 2019,  Mullenweg was forthright about his intention to replace the Tumblr backend with WordPress.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“WordPress is an open source web operating system that can power pretty much anything, including Tumblr.com, but it’s also a large property so will take a bit to figure out and migrate,” Mullenweg said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two years later, in November 2021, the Tumblr changelog <a href=\"https://changes.tumblr.com/post/668673552865804288/tuesday-november-23rd-2021\">noted</a> that the development team was working on a new major version of the beta post editor on web, leveraging parts of Gutenberg. In a Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matias_ventura/status/1530212971150028801\">conversation</a> discussing Tumblr&#8217;s architecture, Gutenberg lead architect Matías Ventura said its implementation of Gutenberg stores everything as JSON, whereas WordPress serializes HTML as the default experience because it needs to work with the ecosystem. In both cases, blocks are created as structured data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m personally looking forward to when you could just copy and paste blocks between platforms like you do with patterns!&#8221; Matías Ventura said when tweeting out the screenshots of Gutenberg on Tumblr and Day One. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sort of interoperability across apps is similar to the idea behind the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/block-protocol-project-aims-to-create-universal-block-system-may-collaborate-with-gutenberg\">Block Protocol</a> project. It aims to build a block system for embedding interactive blocks in any web application. As more of the web embraces the block paradigm, it would be helpful to be able to share blocks across a standardized protocol.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Block Protocol spec is being developed by the team at <a href=\"https://hash.ai/blog/announcing-the-block-protocol\">HASH</a>, which is currently <a href=\"https://hash.ai/careers/wordpress-plugin-developer\">hiring a WordPress developer</a> to create a Block Protocol Gutenberg plugin. The goal of the plugin is to &#8220;unlock the entire Block Protocol ecosystem of blocks for all users of WordPress (both technical and not),&#8221; which would extend the range of blocks available to Gutenberg users. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Block Protocol project was announced, it didn&#8217;t seem likely that it would use Gutenberg as the basis for its spec. However, the wide usage of Gutenberg across the web cannot be ignored. This forthcoming plugin appears to be more like a bridge or connector that ensures Gutenberg is still relevant in the Block Protocol ecosystem. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is an important player in the creation of both blocks and an intuitive editor for publishing them, as the primary incubator for Gutenberg&#8217;s initial development and essentially its first adopter. The block editor making its way to more apps like Tumblr and Day One is a major milestone, and it&#8217;s inspiring to see collaboration on an initiative connecting Gutenberg users with another global registry of blocks designed to move across apps on the web.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 10 Jun 2022 19:40:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:139:\"WPTavern: WordPress 6.1 to Focus On Refining Full-Site Editing, Next Phase Collaboration and Multilingual Features Anticipated in 2023-2025\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=135186\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:149:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-1-to-focus-on-refining-full-site-editing-next-phase-collaboration-and-multilingual-features-anticipated-in-2023-2025\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7918:\"<p>Gutenberg lead architect Matías Ventura has identified refinements to experiences introduced in 5.9 and 6.0 as the main goal for the upcoming 6.1 release.

(The video from the livestream is embedded below.)</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress core contributors plan to close out the Customization phase before beginning on the Collaboration phase in 2023. During the Q&amp;A session, one of the polyglot contributors asked why WordPress is waiting until Phase 4 to begin working on multilingual features in core. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Part of the reason we don&#8217;t want to set data now and then work on the feature later is that we have learned every time that it&#8217;s hard to create the architecture for something without creating the user experience,&#8221; Mullwenweg said. &#8220;When we try to do one without the other, for example with the REST API we got into the REST API before we were fully using it ourselves. As we started to do first-party usage of the REST API with Gutenberg, we found a bunch of gaps. I would feel particularly bad if those gaps meant plugins had been building on the wrong architecture for a few years.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg also explained why he believes it&#8217;s important to prioritize Phase 3, which he referred to as &#8220;workflow,&#8221; before the multilingual features:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Phase 3 is Workflow. This is basically where we&#8217;re going to take real-time co-editing into WordPress, much like Google docs or something else. When you log in to edit a page or your sites or a template or something, if someone else is in there at the same time, you&#8217;ll be able to see them moving around. Of course, we want to make sure we have version control built in like we do for posts and pages, into as many parts of WP as possible, so if someone makes a mistake or an edit to the site, you will be able to roll it back easily, which I think is really key for giving people confidence.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>He emphasized the importance of establishing the collaboration architecture before introducing multilingual support into core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think that the workflows around multilingual are important,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;So where is the content being canonically created, how do changes flow from one language to another, maybe even bi-directionally, depending on the people editing the site, and how that affects the rest of the templates &#8211; things that are outside the post and page content.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also noted the many third-party multilingual solutions that already exist will have a transition period as core integrates these features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I expect that much like has happened with page builders, once there&#8217;s something in core, they will either have a data migration path or integrate with whatever foundation we put into core,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;But I would like to set expectations that it&#8217;s probably more of a 2024 or 2025 initiative for WordPress. And we want to get these other phases done really well first. Why do we have to go in order? We can only do so much at once.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the person who had asked the question pressed for a reason why a contingency work group could not begin now, Mullenweg encouraged any eager contributors to put their work into a plugin. He referenced Gutenberg, which began as a plugin and was tested for years before bringing it into core. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>I would say when we look at phase 4, the first thing we&#8217;re going to look at is how all the plugins are doing it. Perhaps one of those plugins could even become the basis for what comes into core. It&#8217;s OK if the plugins take different architectural approaches, because we want to see pluses and minuses of those. Remember people use WordPress with millions and millions of posts and pages, sometimes tens of millions. We want this to scale, we want this to be performant, we want it to be accessible. Take all the things people know and trust about WordPress. and bring it to this functionality.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg said he thinks multilingual is &#8220;probably going to be one of the most complex things we bring into core, even more so than blocks.&#8221; The reason behind this is because blocks took what WordPress did before and gave it a new interface on top of HTML.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Multilingual is taking every single thing inside of WordPress &#8211; tags, categories, pages, templates, and making it multi-factorial so it&#8217;s like a factorial amount of complexity on top of what right now is more of a one-to-one relationship,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you have some ideas for how to do it, get involved with one of the existing plugins or start your own.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 09 Jun 2022 20:14:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"Do The Woo Community: Extending Your WordPress Plugin for WooCommerce with Mark Westguard and Lesley Sim\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=71684\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"https://dothewoo.io/extending-plugins-woocommerce/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:443:\"<p>Lesley wants to add WooCommerce functionality to her WordPress plugin.

Strattic will continue operating as &#8220;Strattic by Elementor&#8221; and the team will remain as its own unit within the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor founders Yoni Luksenberg and Ariel Klikstein met Strattic founder and CEO Miriam Schwab 10 years ago when they attended a WordCamp she organized in Jerusalem. The following year Elementor sponsored the WordCamp she organized the in Tel Aviv.  In 2020, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/elementor-raises-15-million-plans-to-invest-in-the-team-product-and-community\">Elementor raised $15M</a> its first round of funding, led by Lightspeed Venture Partners, after passing four million users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Schwab founded Strattic in 2018 as the first WordPress hosting company to streamline the creation of static files managed via a headless install. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Very early on it became clear to us at Strattic that we had better make sure we support Elementor in the static versions of our sites,&#8221; Schwab said. &#8220;More and more users were coming to us with sites built on Elementor, which was a strong indication of the plugin’s growing adoption and popularity. We prioritized supporting it in general, including rolling out support for their forms, and most recently adding a Strattic publish button from the Elementor editor.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past year, Elementor has been working to capture the market for the entire website creation process by offering hosting alongside its commercial website builder. Earlier this year, the company launched a Google Cloud-based website hosting service that includes Elementor Pro for $99/year. Elementor will promote the new static hosting service alongside its existing cloud service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t speak exactly to what Elementor&#8217;s strategy is in terms of Strattic vis a vis their cloud offering, but Strattic will be a parallel offering, at least for the foreseeable future,&#8221; Schwab said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor has often been <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenbergs-faster-performance-is-eroding-page-builders-dominance\">criticized for making WordPress sites sluggish</a> so it&#8217;s easy to see the appeal that static hosting brings. Having more customers on Strattic might lessen the urgency of fixing Elementor&#8217;s well-documented speed issues. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This acquisition will allow us to leverage Strattic’s technology to build static websites, helping to solve stability, speed, and security issues in the dynamic sites space,&#8221; Elementor founder Yoni Luksenberg said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With static hosting, users can deploy their dynamic WordPress websites as static HTML/CSS replicas to global CDN networks, which drastically improves the performance of their sites and eliminates potential security vulnerabilities and site breakdowns during updates. With a dramatically reduced attack surface, WordPress vulnerabilities become irrelevant as security is no longer a defensive endeavor.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor users who sign on for Strattic&#8217;s static hosting approach will have a more stable and secure experience, as the plugin and related third-party add-ons are <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/elementor-3-6-3-patches-critical-remote-code-execution-vulnerability\">frequently</a> <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/elementor-patches-xss-vulnerabilities-affecting-7-million-wordpress-sites\">patching</a> <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/essential-addons-for-elementor-patches-critical-security-vulnerability\">critical</a> <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/attackers-continue-to-exploit-vulnerabilities-in-the-plus-addons-for-elementor-plugin\">vulnerabilities</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strattic and Elementor customers can expect deeper integration across these products in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We already have great support for Elementor on our static sites, but of course there&#8217;s always room for improvement so we will be working with Elementor&#8217;s team to make the integration even better,&#8221; Schwab said. She also confirmed there are no pricing changes on the horizon for Strattic customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Right now everything will stay pretty much the same for Strattic users. We hope they&#8217;ll soon start to feel the benefit of us joining Elementor in terms of faster release cycles of amazing new features that will make the product even better.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 08 Jun 2022 19:26:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"Do The Woo Community: WooCommerce Announces Functionality for Card Reader\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=71917\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-announces-functionality-for-card-reader/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:419:\"<p>The press release, received today, announces the features that allow fast transactions and automatic inventory syncing.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-announces-functionality-for-card-reader/\">WooCommerce Announces Functionality for Card Reader</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 08 Jun 2022 15:25:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WPTavern: #29 – Remkus de Vries on How WordCamp Europe Got Started\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=135131\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/29-remkus-de-vries-on-how-wordcamp-europe-got-started\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34790:\"<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://remkus.devries.frl\">Remkus de Vries</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remkus is kicking off what might be described as a&nbsp; mini series on the Jukebox podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week almost 3,000 WordPressers from all over the world gathered together in Porto, Portugal for the first in-person <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2022/\">WordCamp Europe</a> since 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Expectations were high, and the event did not disappoint.

I hope that you understand that the vagaries of real life were at play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so back to Remkus. Remkus is one of the founders of WordCamp Europe, just over 10 years ago. I wanted to get him on the podcast to talk about how the community&#8217;s largest WordCamp got started. I also wanted to find out how the current event compares in terms of size and organization. What has changed over the years?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the importance of events like WordCamps for the community and how over the last few years, the lack of in-person events has altered the community. Remkus is a colorful character and full of interesting insights, which are always worth listening to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading over to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast. And you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes there as well. And so without further delay, I bring you, Remkus de Vries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Remkus de Vries. Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:31] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> Hello Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Remkus Remkus and I go back, not a really long way, but we&#8217;re going to talk about a journey which takes him back a long way. Tell us about yourself, your relationship with WordPress. Ignore all the WordCamp Europe bits. If you cannot, otherwise, we&#8217;ll have nothing left to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:44] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> Ah, okay, okay. My relationship with WordPress. Wow, that is taking me a ways back. So I think the first time I, so I played with WordPress the first time for a couple of months before I did anything serious with it, but this is 2004. I had a bunch of clients at the time, which, we&#8217;re either on Mambo or Joomla, and the ones on Mambo, I was in the process of moving them over. Really didn&#8217;t like the process, but you do what you gotta do with the tools that you have. And at the end of 2005, if I remember correctly, WordPress introduced pages, which then made me switch every single client that I have, which was about 20. I ported their Joomla or Mambo theme over to WordPress because now we have static pages, and I haven&#8217;t looked back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:30] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Been going strong ever since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:32] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> Yeah. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We&#8217;re here to talk about WordCamp Europe because, well we&#8217;re at WordCamp Europe. Let&#8217;s talk about this one just specifically how much you&#8217;ve enjoyed it. When did you arrive?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:44] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:45] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So that was one, no two days before the contributor day. On none of the podcasts that we&#8217;ve recorded before have we talked about Porto the place or anything like that? So let&#8217;s do a little bit of that. I think this location is pretty spectacular. How are you enjoying Porto?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:59] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> Porto is very nice. It&#8217;s a little bit like home in terms of the weather. And it&#8217;s a lot not like home because there is elevation. For us, it&#8217;s a 35 minute walk to get here and we&#8217;ve tried quite a few different routes getting here. And whatever you pick, you always end up walking uphill. Which I found interesting, but it highlights the things I like about Porto, because there is nooks and crannies and corners and things you constantly find. Sure there&#8217;s architecture, but if I&#8217;m really honest, I&#8217;ve seen so many European cities, that is roughly the same everywhere. Yeah, the play with the hills and the twisty roads and things like that. I really enjoy it. Plus we&#8217;re close to the sea, as someone who grew up around water, I like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Oh, it&#8217;s absolutely brilliant. I completely share your comment about the hills. So far, I&#8217;ve only walked up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:48] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> So I&#8217;m here with my son and he keeps saying, uh, you&#8217;re getting old. And, and the last couple of days I take the Uber getting here and he&#8217;s said, I&#8217;m going to walk. I&#8217;m like, fine. I&#8217;m okay with that. I like the Uber now, cause I walked so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:01] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;ve got to ask about your son. Is he into WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:05] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> Kinda, sort of. His number one passion, and that is in not just a capital P, but the whole word is in capitals is music. He is doing a Dutch version of Juilliard&#8217;s, if that rings a bell. So it&#8217;s a school that is essentially on the performance arts. I think the official name is the Academy of Pop Culture, and he does music. So that consumes his life. There have been periods where I have used him when we had client migrations. So he&#8217;s done content management mostly. So he understands WordPress. It just hasn&#8217;t built anything in it himself. So we drove up here, so it&#8217;s a father and son road trip, have fun together. and that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How long did it take to get here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:41] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> We had a short break in a Bilbao. We spent the night there, so I think all in total 21 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I didn&#8217;t know you brought your son. But he&#8217;s not here in the venue?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:51] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> He is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:52] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So he&#8217;s taking part, he&#8217;s not just enjoying Porto?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:54] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> He likes to hang out with people I like to hang out with. So we were, we&#8217;re all good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:57] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Ah, nice. And have you&#8217;ve been enjoying, again, we haven&#8217;t discussed this so far, a large proportion of the excitement about WordPress events, WordCamps in particular is the sort of stuff that goes on around the edges. You know, the hallway track. The after parties and all that. We haven&#8217;t had the after-party yet, but there&#8217;s been lots of social events organized in the evenings. Has that side been enriching and fun?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:17] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> Very much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You enjoy that bit as much as anybody?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:20] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Because I think one of the key components for people who want to be at these events, but maybe don&#8217;t want to be at these events if you know what I mean? You&#8217;re nervous. It&#8217;s all going to be about code. I don&#8217;t write code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:31] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:33] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There&#8217;s a load of social stuff going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:34] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> So, that whole chain of thought needs to stop anyway, because it is not about code. at one point I&#8217;ve I&#8217;ve been, quoted saying, I came for the software. I came home with family. So, if you keep that in mind, it means there&#8217;s a lot more going on than just this is the code we work with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a CMS we work with and the CMS allows us to do things. And there are many other people that have the similar experience. Like it facilitates them, it empowers them. It&#8217;s not just the content creators themselves democratizing publishing. It&#8217;s not just that. There&#8217;s a whole ecosystem around of people being empowered to use a particular piece of software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the fun thing about WordPress is, as it so happens that the large majority of people enjoying the software turn out also to like each other in real life. So the community part, and then the social component of that gets highlighted at WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So is it true to say that you, I know that you just said it and it sounded like a trope, but hand on heart, you&#8217;ve got real life friends, in the strictest sense of the word that you never would have known.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:37] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. That&#8217;s really fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:39] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> Yeah, and not a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:40] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. You are quite gregarious, I think. You are very good at, being out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:45] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> I&#8217;m not necessarily an extrovert but, among friends, among like-minded it doesn&#8217;t cost me energy. So I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m a very comfortable semi introvert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:53] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Let&#8217;s talk to the people out there though who may be introverted. Who think, you know what? There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m going to a WordPress event. There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m going to a WordCamp, big one, like WordCamp Europe, or a smaller one that may be in a particular country. Just tell us a little bit about the stuff which is on hand to help them get through it. Cause I know there&#8217;s a lot of preparation and a lot of thought has been put in to make this as accessible as possible well, basically to quieten any nerves for anybody who may be just thinking, okay, this is not for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:20] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> So the only thing overwhelming that we cannot take away is the number of people, right? So if a small WordCamp for 200 people is a trigger for you, we can&#8217;t solve that. WordCamp Europe in the 2000 plus, is not going to solve that either, but what we can do is provide an open environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right? So what we do is we make sure that all the angles that we can cover, meaning if you&#8217;d like to sit aside in the corner, you can. There is space to do that, from within the rooms where the presentations are, to what you mentioned earlier, hallway tracks, right? There&#8217;s spaces, there&#8217;s hallways, there&#8217;s various places where you can hang out where you can sit where you can relax a bit, collect your thoughts if that&#8217;s needed, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the other thing you will find is, like I mentioned earlier, there&#8217;s a lot of like-minded people. And if you are, I think suffering is too big of a word, but if you are in need of anything, you will be spotted and someone will come and, uh, ask are you okay? Is there something I can do to help? So, the whole environment we have is to facilitate the most diverse audience you can think of. That includes the accessibility type of stuff. We have captioning for the live talks. We take into account that if someone creates a presentation, color contrast is correct. So color blinds. You know, I&#8217;m just giving random examples of things that think of in order to facilitate everyone as much as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;re an introvert, it&#8217;s going to cost you some energy, sure, but it&#8217;s also going to give you a lot. And at the very least it&#8217;s people you somewhat maybe already know from online interactions and stuff, especially Twitter is good at that. It&#8217;s going to help you cement that sort of relationship into a more, I&#8217;m sitting across from you now, uh, Nathan, and we&#8217;ve spoken quite a few times already, but this is the first time we&#8217;re properly sitting across each other. It&#8217;s different in real life than it is when you&#8217;re, through the digital world are connecting. So the advantage of that is tremendous.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m sitting across from you, as you just said, and you&#8217;ve got the lanyard around your neck and it&#8217;s got your name on it. And so if you wish to wear that, everybody can figure out what your name is. Actually, that really does prevent a lot of awkward moments because it&#8217;s totally okay to stare at that. I&#8217;ve done that so many times, hello, and you don&#8217;t have to say, what&#8217;s your name? You just go, oh, hi Remkus and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also curiously, and I think I&#8217;ve not seen this before. Well, I&#8217;ve not seen it at other events. Your lanyard yard has a green sticker. Why has it got a green sticker?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:43] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> So we&#8217;ve added, we&#8217;ve had this for a few additions now. So on your lanyard, like you said, it says your name and the sticker, that we have some sticker options and one of them has to indicate I&#8217;m okay with you if you approach me..</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m okay. if, if you want to start talking to me. And I am. But there&#8217;s also a sticker that indicates I&#8217;d rather keep my distance. And if, if I want to talk I&#8217;ll approach you instead of you me. So, you know, for those in need, it&#8217;s a great mechanism to help you be as comfortable as can be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. It&#8217;s because there are all sorts of people here. There are some fairly gregarious people, and if you have, if you&#8217;re just wandering around, there is a chance that you may be just spoken to by random people, cause that happens quite a lot. If you&#8217;re wearing the red one, so I&#8217;m guessing there&#8217;s red, yellow, amber and green, red basically indicates look, I&#8217;m happy to be in this environment, but I would rather it that you just left me to it. I&#8217;m wandering about, to stay wandering about by myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:37] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> Yeah. I don&#8217;t think the percentage that is using a red one is particularly that high, but it&#8217;s a mechanism that&#8217;s very easy to implement. It&#8217;s very easy if for those who actually need it to use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There&#8217;s loads of other things, there&#8217;s quiet spaces, there&#8217;s places where you can go and just be quiet. There&#8217;s childcare for, from really early ages, right up 16. If you to take, take that on board, you know, so if the impediment to coming is that you&#8217;ve got children, well it need not be, I can&#8217;t speak for the other events elsewhere, but this one, that&#8217;s happening. There&#8217;s also a ton of nice food, and there&#8217;s a ton of space outside. And we&#8217;re lucky enough that in Porto, we&#8217;ve really managed to avoid the poor weather which was predicted to land.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:17] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> Well, we had a bit of the rain yesterday, but you know, it&#8217;s fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:19] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> But there&#8217;s tons of outdoor space, so there&#8217;s lots of opportunities to just go and hang out. Yeah, there&#8217;s absolutely loads put on. Right, but the question remains is why are you here talking about this? And the reason you&#8217;re here talking about this is because you were one of the founders of the whole enterprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re at year 10 and there&#8217;s badges and posters all over the place saying happy birthday. Ten years old. You&#8217;re like the father of this along with other mothers and fathers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:49] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> Yes. Yes. So the very first WordCamp I went to was WordCamp Netherlands, and it was also the very first WordCamp I organized. So, what that did is introduced a lot of people from the European continent came to the first WordCamp Netherlands. Through that I got to meet other people that I enjoyed spending time with. One of them was uh, Zé Fontainhas from Portugal. Over the next two years, we found each other at various WordCamps in Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We both quite quick landed on the idea together that, wouldn&#8217;t it be great if we would have one event in Europe uniting all of Europe as a community? Because we looked at the United States and they have, at that time they had WordPress San Francisco, which is now moving around and called WordCamp US. So we saw there is no European equivalent of it. Fast forward another year, we were in January 2012. We were with a bunch of friends, we were in what we call WP on tour. We rented an incredibly nice and a very, very interesting villa, ask me later. Yeah, so we introduced the idea to other folks there. We got a lot of excitement about it. And then as it so happens, Zé and I, and some other friends were invited for the inaugural WordPress community summit in 2012, October, where Matt and the representative of WordPress Central was also going to be. So we pitched the idea there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had to do some convincing and explaining like, why? Because the rule at the time was you cannot do regional WordCamps. It has to be city-based. Especially this large of a region, Europe sounds like one thing, but it most certainly is not, depending on whichever definition you look up. We eventually got the go ahead, and with, with the slight contingent if I remember correctly, like, we&#8217;ll see how it goes, if it works ,out great, and if it doesn&#8217;t, you know, we tried. that&#8217;s essentially how this whole thing started becoming a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Where was the first actual one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:46] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> In Leiden, the Netherlands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:47] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Let&#8217;s just draw out over those 10 years where we&#8217;ve got, but let&#8217;s just quickly paint the picture where we are today. WordCamp Europe, 2022. I think correct me if I&#8217;m wrong. 2,700 attendees. I don&#8217;t know how many volunteers, but many, many hundreds, I think because there are, yeah, there&#8217;s t-shirts everywhere. So we&#8217;re definitely I would imagine over 3000 people involved. So let&#8217;s go back 10 years. What did that look like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:16] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> I think we sold 832 tickets and we had about 780 people actually showing up. So the actual turnout percentage was extremely high, but we were already happy we were past 500. Cause we had no idea where it was going to land. Right, so at the time, we started organizing it, with selling tickets early 2013. And we had kind of an idea of how many we should be able to get in terms of attendees, we didn&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So at that time countries like France had a small but upcoming WordPress community. Spain was very active. The Netherlands, I was quite active. Portugal as well. But, Italy for instance was fragmented. Serbia close to non-existent, and I think you see where I&#8217;m going with. The whole goal was for us to unite, to be in the same room, talk to each other, learn about each other and see that we are, we have a common goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was the purpose of working in Europe. But we didn&#8217;t know how many people see the same purpose. See the same benefit. So we had initially said, you know, 500, we&#8217;re good, we&#8217;re good. Nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:24] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So in what ways was it different? The reason I asked that question is because, I&#8217;ve only been to two WordCamp Europes. I went to the previous one in Berlin, which was actually now three years ago. Paint a picture of the difference between what it was like in the first one and what it&#8217;s like now. And the reason I&#8217;m asking that is because here it really, really feels incredibly slick and professional. They both had that feel about them. Was it always thus, or were the first ones a bit more cottage industry? Just tell us what was different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:56] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> I&#8217;d like to think that from the experience of those who were attending, it has been a good experience from the early beginning. Having said that there is a lot of room for improvement as we were doing the first one, we quickly realized there was a lot of things we could do better, should do better. All that. But I think the challenge more has been, as we grew, the amount of effort you have to put in is not, in my experience. is not a linear one. It&#8217;s more of a, what do you call that in English?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Parabola.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:28] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> Parabola, there you go. So, as you mentioned, there was a lot of volunteers here because the amount of that is just vastly increased. So Yes, there&#8217;s a lot of things that have been much smoother and better taken care of. At the end of WordCamp Europe in Leiden, all of us on the organizing team were absolutely exhausted. Like full on. I&#8217;m not saying they&#8217;re not exhausted now here, but I&#8217;m also telling you it&#8217;s quite different to the level of stress that we had that first time, because nobody knew.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every single person there had organized WordCamps before. So we picked that. Some had less experience or maybe just a meetup type of stuff but everybody had some type of experience. So we leaned on each other mostly. But the size is the quantifier there, that determines how much more you have to do. At every single WordCamp after, I get stopped by people all the time, saying hi, some will say, how much they&#8217;ve enjoyed every single one since the first one and all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And uh, some will start reminding me of things happened during the first one or the second one, even. I go like, yeah, I don&#8217;t know. Cos it&#8217;s been a blur. I don&#8217;t know how many kilometers I walked that first one, but it&#8217;s been a lot just in the venue. Cause I was running back and forth constantly because there&#8217;s all these little things we need to take care of in the moment. Now, we know all those things. So we do take care of that before it actually happens. So it&#8217;s, you know, it&#8217;s most certainly has done way more professional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Media coverage is one, but, the video recording is another. The captioning. You know, everything we can do to make it better, that has happened continuously. So yes, I think it was quite all right, the first organization. But it&#8217;s gotten way better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> It really does feel like Google IO or something like that, you know, incredibly professional and incredibly well managed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:17] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> That&#8217;s a great compliment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you see events like this as, they&#8217;re a nice thing to do. You know, you turn up your watch speakers, you hang out and you make friends and all of that kind of stuff. Is it, is it more? Is it more the glue that binds the community together?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:32] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> It&#8217;s both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:32] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, because the reason I&#8217;m asking that is because in the last, everybody knows what happened over the last two years. I don&#8217;t need to spell it out, but we had a hiatus, a couple of years. Kind of feels to me, as if things went off the rails a bit with the community. Not like it felt a pieces, but it just had to adapt and feels like there&#8217;s this collective sigh of relief and almost every conversation that I had in the first day for the first few hours until everybody got out of their system was, oh, it&#8217;s so nice to be back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:00] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> Yeah, and it is, it is. I think the glue part is way more important than people thought that it was. You have the same thing happening. So you and I meet over, you know, when I join your podcast, you and I, we do it over a digital connection. It&#8217;s a small screen. It shows a part of your body and it has a diminished version of you. And that&#8217;s vice versa. So there&#8217;s a layer of information I&#8217;m not getting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think you can say the same thing for what we&#8217;re seeing here. Yes, you can be connected. You can have great relationships online and everything, but the real deal is in real life. That&#8217;s where you make the actual connections. As you mentioned before we started the podcast, you said, I can&#8217;t believe how big you are. So that&#8217;s the thing I keep hearing, right. but you see that in real life. That&#8217;s an example of information you don&#8217;t get when you look at me, cause you have no idea what my surrounding and what. the proportions is. And that&#8217;s such a simple example, but there&#8217;s like, I look you straight in the eyes, that&#8217;s already different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have things you say that you then in real life have time to correct If that wasn&#8217;t the intent that you actually had. All of these little things make up what that glue actually exists of so, not having that for two years creates a like a vacuum of things that are not seen, not communicated, not spoken about, not processed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, there&#8217;ve been companies started from WordCamps. There have been mergers started. There have been friends made there have been marriages come from WordCamps. Everything happens when you&#8217;re together,. Uh, which is one of the prime goals that we had. So I know the theme here is the 10th edition. If I&#8217;m really honest, it&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s the eighth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> That&#8217;s a good point. Ten years separated the first and the last.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:43] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> Yeah, So online costs me energy. So I barely, barely put any time and effort into that. In real life, gives me energy. As much energy as it costs. So you&#8217;re absorbing information all day. You talk to people all day, which you normally don&#8217;t do. You go out, have drinks, have fun, whatever. That costs energy, but the net result is I have energy. I get energized. Maybe that&#8217;s the better way. Online sucks the life out of me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:11] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s really interesting. And I think, from the core team, the message, I could be misrepresenting this, but I think that the message was that contributions dropped off a bit. People seem to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:24] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> I&#8217;m sure it has. I&#8217;m sure it has, but I think that&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s necessarily something that&#8217;s attributed to not meeting in real life per se. I think that&#8217;s more attributed to stuff going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. Would it be fair to say that during the last couple of years, you&#8217;ve sort of stepped away from WordPress a bit? You&#8217;ve a little bit less, less fired up about it. And, and are you back, are you back where you were a couple of, three years ago?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:47] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> I&#8217;m going to quote LL Cool J. LL Cool J said don&#8217;t call it a comeback, I&#8217;ve been here for years. So I&#8217;ve never really left, but I&#8217;ve most certainly moved to more lurking, on the side. Life and work was too busy to be as engaged as I was previously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If people want to get involved, they&#8217;ve got to commit a long time in advance to being a volunteer or an organizer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:11] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> Not that long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:13] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> How do they do it? Where do they go? What kind of channels do they need to be visiting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:16] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> So, inside your WordPress dashboard, there&#8217;s a little widget and that tells you where there are meetups relative, close to your location. So that&#8217;s the first thing to check out. They don&#8217;t necessarily need volunteers yet, but it gives you, a, an idea to check out what&#8217;s going on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are all those people are raving about, right? Why should I even bother going? Once you find one that you like, you&#8217;ll start meeting people, and maybe you want to use a WordCamp in, I live in the Netherlands. so maybe you want to use a WordCamp in Germany as a, as a nice excuse to get out. So you go to Germany, maybe from there you go like, hmm, interesting, I kind of want to see this grow further. I want to give this my a devotion and time. Every single WordCamp that is up and coming is on central.wordcamp.org. Check them out. Find one you like and see if they are looking for volunteers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe the call for volunteers hasn&#8217;t gone out yet. Maybe you would even like to speak. Maybe even you&#8217;d like to organize. Everything is possible. It&#8217;s open. And in some cases you need experienced organizers. In some cases there&#8217;s plenty of room for new people to learn. So we always include new people to learn. and that can be you. That can even be you Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:26] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yes, yes. I think I&#8217;ve found my niche. Sitting on a chair talking into a microphone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:32] <strong>Remkus de Vries:</strong> But you&#8217;re jokingly saying this, but that is actually part of what is contributing. It&#8217;s not a predefined thing, like you need to write code or you need to do translations or you need to help this or this or that. It is whatever helps the project. This is helping the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> There are literally hundreds of roles. I&#8217;ve been quite surprised by the different things I&#8217;ve seen people doing. Obviously there&#8217;s people standing, handing out microphones, there&#8217;s people, moving boxes. There&#8217;s people printing tickets. There&#8217;s people showing time. Yeah. You know, there&#8217;s people making sure that.

Nevertheless, I wanted you to have all of below links, so here it is the Weekend Edition on a Tuesday 🙂  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first regional in-person WordCamp was a great start into the next phase of Community events.  Approx 800 people worked on the open-source project on Contributor Day and approx 1,500 more attendees joined in for talks, workshops, conversations at the WP Cafe, populated the Sponsor Hall and run into each other on the Hallway Track.  It was not without its challenges, though. Enforcing the in-door mask mandate was surprisingly difficult for an supposedly adult population. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the organizers and volunteers with the help of the venue staff, sponsors and speaker produced a high-level extra-ordinary WordCamp together. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will have more insights from WordCamp Europe in following editions.  For now I leave you with an impression of the fabulous branding of <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2022/organisers/#design-team\">WordCamp Europe design team</a>. Below you&#8217;ll find the links to the Live-streamed talks on YouTube. </p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2022/\"><img /></a>\n\n\n\n<p>The last two weeks were filled with lot of WordPress news, not all Block editor related, though. Enjoy the catch-up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yours, 💕<br /><em>Birgit</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>PS: More numbers: Five years ago, I started curating news about Gutenberg, after watching the first release video at WordCamp Europe, that took place in Paris in 2017. This year, WordCamp Europe celebrated its 10-year anniversary. Last week, Saturday was the 20-year anniversary of Pauli Systems, the web development company I founded in 2002 and closed earlier this year. Just saying. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-5 wp-block-group has-light-background-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-sortabrilliant-guidepost\"><ul><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#0-word-camp-europe\">WordCamp Europe</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#2-word-press-6-0\">WordPress 6.0 </a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#3-gutenberg-13-3\">Gutenberg 13.3 </a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#4-word-press-6-1\">WordPress 6.1 </a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#4-b\">Miscellenous Block Editor news</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#5-word-press-social-learning-events\">WordPress Social Learning Events</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#6-other-word-press-events\">Other WordPress Events</a></li></ul></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"0-word-camp-europe\">WordCamp Europe</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you didn&#8217;t get a chance to watch them on the live stream or want to follow-up on them, here are the links to YouTube for the Block-editor related talks Track 1.

This task can be a big hurdle for newcomers to the platform. The prospect of narrowing down the right plugin from a directory of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/\">more than 59,000</a> can be daunting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team behind <a href=\"https://rtcamp.com/\">rtCamp</a>, a 125-person agency and a WordPress VIP Gold agency partner, has launched a new tool called <a href=\"https://wpplugincompare.com/\">WordPress Plugin Compare Project</a> (WPPC) to help users extend WordPress with the right plugins for their needs. WPPC lets users search for plugins to compare and customize each selection displayed on the chart:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The chart displays the age of the plugin, when it was last updated, author, current version, required WP version, required PHP version, and tested up to WP version. It also shows important stats for ratings, total downloads, active installs, support requests and support score. Plugin data is refreshed twice per day, so it&#8217;s always up to date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several major plugin categories where multiple plugins are competing against one another are good candidates for comparison using the WPPC tool, including e-commerce, SEO, analytics, social sharing, performance, block libraries, forms, and security, to name a few. Plug in a few of the top contenders and it&#8217;s easier to see at a glance how they compare in terms of popularity, maintenance, and support. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The comparisons can also be linked. For example, the <a href=\"https://wpplugincompare.com/compare?plugins=genesis-blocks,coblocks,kadence-blocks,otter-blocks\">block collection plugin comparison</a> above and the <a href=\"https://wpplugincompare.com/compare?plugins=contact-form-7,ninja-forms,formidable,wpforms-lite\">forms plugin comparison</a> below is available on the WPPC website. The comparison URL includes each of the four plugin slugs and the tool pulls up the chart on demand. That makes it easy to text or email someone who needs help selecting a plugin for a project. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>rtCamp plans to expand the capabilities of the WPPC tool to include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Additional parameters in the comparison table (e.g. supported languages, performance data, code quality, etc.)</li><li>Single plugin page with all the data laid out in a presentable manner</li><li>“Other plugins by the same author” page</li><li>A dedicated page with filters where one can filter across all 55K+ plugins</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>After testing the tool, I found the search to be a little buggy. Searching plugins by  name or slug sometimes doesn&#8217;t work correctly. Overall, it&#8217;s very easy to use and amazing how it pulls in all the plugins&#8217; details into the comparison table automatically. Additional columns could be helpful in certain categories where there are more than four decent plugin options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One feature that would be useful is the ability to filter the search to only show plugins that offer blocks or support the block editor. This could also work as one of the parameters in the comparison table. One of the most frustrating things about searching the WordPress Plugin Directory is sorting through to see which results support blocks. While you can browse <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/browse/blocks/\">block-enabled plugins</a>, there&#8217;s no easy way to search for block-enabled plugins only. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>rtCamp is aiming to raise the bar for free plugins hosted on WordPress.org with the WPPC tool. If it becomes more popular, plugin authors may feel more pressure to compete in their listings by providing more active maintenance and support. It also quickly identifies which plugins have been around the longest. Since WordPress.org is the primary distribution channel for many plugin businesses, a tool like this can quickly highlight any glaring deficiency in a product if its creators are not consistent with updates and support. These are important considerations when selecting a mission-critical tool, like forms or e-commerce, in a business or non-profit&#8217;s suite of plugins.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 06 Jun 2022 20:35:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"Post Status: Post Status Notes #501\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=98546\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-notes-501/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1185:\"<strong>Elementor</strong> acquires <strong>Strattic</strong> • <strong>WP Engine</strong> acquires <strong>Delicious Brains</strong>\' plugins 🧠 • <em>When the Cathedrals own the Bazaars and Shopping Centers and you\'re in a strip mall with a fruit stand...</em> • <strong>Jetpack</strong> decouples • <strong>InstaWP</strong> gets seed funding from <strong>Automattic</strong> 🌱 • <strong>Automattic</strong> hire #2000 • World-class <strong>FSE</strong>, how? 🌐 • <strong>WCEU</strong> by the numbers • <strong>Weglot</strong> gives back • <strong>RoleUp</strong> rolls out • <strong>Tadlock</strong> exits <strong>WP Tavern</strong> 🍺 • Why \'why\' matters most • The Big 2-0 next year • All there is to know about core WordPress email notifications, documented ✉️ • System font stack check • Do not follow by default • <strong>Museum of Block Art</strong> opens 🎨 • Meet <strong>Yvonne Doll</strong> • Mostly modest WordPress wishlists • <strong>WooCommerce Experts</strong> to go global • How to do well in a downturn 📉 • Some things we don\'t — but ought to — talk about. 🐘 Silent no longer about Sustainability.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 03 Jun 2022 22:33:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"David Bisset\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"WPTavern: Five for the Future Program Set To Adopt Official Definition for Pledges and Contributions\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=135063\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:111:\"https://wptavern.com/five-for-the-future-program-set-to-adopt-official-definition-for-pledges-and-contributions\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4824:\"<img />photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/seed-tree-01MVFCVHOD\">Christian Joudrey</a>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress&#8217; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\">Five for the Future</a> program, an initiative that encourages organizations to contribute five percent of their resources to WordPress development, is poised to adopt an official definition for what constitutes pledges and contributions. Two weeks ago, WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/2022/05/20/defining-five-for-the-future-pledges-contributions/\">proposed</a> the program make a clear distinction between ecosystem contributions and core project contributions:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><strong>Participation in Five for the Future means consistent effort by an individual or a company via a Make WordPress team to directly support the WordPress open source project and the project’s current </strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2022/01/21/our-three-big-ideas-for-2022/\"><strong>big ideas</strong></a><strong>, rather than the sole benefit of a company or individual.</strong> Simply put, Five for the Future exists to collaboratively invest in the health of the WordPress project, ensuring its long-term sustainability and success.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Haden Chomphosy further clarified that certain contributions fall within a grey area but still fit within this definition, such as mataining WordPress.org, WordCamp.org, Rosetta networks, documentation, training, or speaking at meetups. She also specified another grey area that does not fit within the official definition. This includes things like creating WordPress sites, themes, plugins, or blocks, and providing support.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;These activities are critical to extending the reach and utility of the WordPress project, but they are not considered part of making Five for the Future commitments,&#8221; Haden Chomphosy said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are many important efforts and lots of incredible work performed outside of WordPress.org and Make Teams. While these are indispensable activities that further the WordPress ecosystem, Five for the Future is about ensuring that the WordPress project continues to be a fertile foundation for WordPress extenders and users.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was always the unspoken understanding of the Five for the Future program but this proposal formalizes it ahead of building out official tracking efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The general consensus in the resulting discussion was agreement on the first part of the definition, that the contribution must move the open source project forward. A few participants were not convinced that themes and plugins would not qualify as a contribution towards this goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I can’t help but wonder about the argument to be made that the creation of themes, plugins and blocks that are made freely available are also contributions that move WordPress forward,&#8221; GoDaddy-sponsored contributor Adam Warner said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yoast-sponsored contributor Yvette Sonneveld said the term &#8220;grey area&#8221; has a negative connotation and that &#8220;all the activities are essential to keep the software and community healthy and thriving.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I fully understand that these are harder to quantify,&#8221; Sonneveld said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Personally, I agree that themes and plugins brought out under creative commons licenses also help the software and the community thrive, and should be included in the efforts that help the project move forward.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The definition did not receive much pushback and appears to be already confirmed, as Automattic-sponsored community organizer Angela Jin <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/project/2022/05/23/request-for-feedback-recording-five-for-the-future-contributions/\">posted</a> three days later, asking for feedback on how to identify and record contirbutions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Based on the definition we now have of 5ftF contributions, what other activity, specific to a Make Team or across multiple teams, should be recognized and recorded?&#8221; Jin said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program&#8217;s activity is <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/five-for-the-future/issues\">tracked on GitHub</a>, where discussions are open on everything from stats to badges to tracking meetup attendance. Many of these are technical issues that will require building charts and dashboards. It will be interesting to see how  the community and meta teams tackle these challenges to track contributions across teams.

The service <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/instawp-launches-new-service-for-disposable-wordpress-testing-sites\">launched in July 2021</a> as a quick way to set up testing or disposable WordPress sites and users frequently commented on remarkable speed of the tool, which spins up a site in less than a second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Founder Vikas Singhal said the investment gives Automattic a percentage of future equity under a SAFE (simple agreement for future equity) arrangement. In order to receive the investment, Singhal was required to register InstaWP Inc. as an independent US-based organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;InstaWP has a vision of making it easy to get started with WordPress,&#8221; Singhal said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Initally I thought InstaWP was just a disposable WP tool but fast forward eight months, it&#8217;s much more than that. It&#8217;s a workflow tool now, which makes working with WP 10x easier.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>InstaWP provided an Agency plan for LearnWP to use during Social Learning Spaces, Calls for Testing, and similar uses. The fact that it&#8217;s being used in WordPress education, where some users are brand new to the platform, speaks to how user-friendly it is to fire up a new WordPress testing site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Lots of plugin and theme authors use it for showcasing their product sandboxes,&#8221; Singhal said. &#8220;Agencies are using it to build and deliver websites for their clients. Many developers are using it for end to end testing as well.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Singhal reports more than 23,000 sites have been created with InstaWP. The service currently has 1,600 free users and 50+ paid users. It offers paid plans from $9/month to $59/month and custom pricing for enterprise customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Singhal said the seed funding &#8220;should last for about next 18-24 months,&#8221; as InstaWP has ramped up hiring and marketing. He anticipates the company will be profitable by the end of the year and is open to more investors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>InstaWP is working on developing native integrations for hosting providers, which would allow users to connect their accounts, see a list of existing sites or create new ones, and select a production site to &#8220;push&#8221; to from InstaWP. The company is currently working with Runcloud and GoDaddy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We have come a long from being a disposable WP tool,&#8221; Singhal said. &#8220;InstaWP will become a great gateway to WordPress, covering all the use cases such as build, dev, test, showcase, and educate. We will be connecting hosting providers, product vendors and agencies/freelancers alike in a single platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We want to become the AWS for the WordPress world, providing an easy way for people to build sites without thinking about the underlying platform.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 03 Jun 2022 17:30:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"Post Status: WordPress Podcast and Video Picks for the Week of May 29\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=98548\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-podcast-and-video-picks-for-the-week-of-may-29/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:316:\"Vikas Singhal on InstaWP\'s backing from Automattic • Raffaella Isidori on the importance of UX • How to get the most out of WordCamps • Peter Suhm on Reform • Josepha Haden Chomphosy shares her open-source reading list • Hiring and <code>capital_p_dangit</code> • Ryan Welcher live-coding block templates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 03 Jun 2022 06:00:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"David Bisset\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WPTavern: WP Engine Acquires 5 Plugins From Delicious Brains\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=135014\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-acquires-5-plugins-from-delicious-brains\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3487:\"<img />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://deliciousbrains.com/\">Delicious Brains</a>, a WordPress product company founded in 2012 by Brad Touesnard, has sold five of its plugins to <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/blog/wp-engine-acquires-delicious-brains-plugins-including-advanced-custom-fields/\">WP Engine</a>: Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), WP Migrate, WP Offload Media, WP Offload SES, and Better Search Replace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past four years, WP Engine has been scooping up developer tools through acquisitions, including StudioPress and the Genesis Framework (<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-acquires-studiopress\">2018</a>), Flywheel and its Local development tool (<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-acquires-flywheel\">2019</a>) and the Frost block theme (<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-acquires-brian-gardners-frost-opens-it-to-the-public\">2021</a>). The five Delicious Brains plugins, which are active on more than four million WordPress sites, greatly expand WP Engine&#8217;s reach into the developer market. ACF, which allows developers to control WordPress edit screens and custom field data, accounts for two million users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Delicious Brains will continue with its <a href=\"https://spinupwp.com/\">SpinupWP</a> product which allows developers to spin up a server and manage it via a cloud-based control panel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What if I could exit the plugin side of the business but keep SpinupWP and continue on with that project and its team?&#8221; Touesnard said in a post explaining why he sold the plugins. &#8220;The more I thought about it, the more I liked the idea. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In the previous 18 months, we had gone from 10 people to 34. I was now a manager of managers and also directing marketing &#8211; not my strongest areas and I was stretched pretty thin so not doing my best work. At the same time, I wasn’t spending nearly as much time on SpinupWP as I would have liked.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Touesnard pitched the idea of selling the plugins to his connections at WP Engine and they were enthusiastic. The company is also acqui-hiring several members of the Delcious Brains team to continue supporting the products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’ve often said that if for some reason I couldn’t work for a month or more that Iain Poulson would step up and keep Delicious Brains running and thriving without me,&#8221; Touesnard said. &#8220;He has been with Delicious Brains since the early days, has worked across all the products, and makes sure that things get done that need doing. I’m very happy to say that Iain will be joining WP Engine, overseeing the continued development of ACF. Matt Shaw and Liam Gladdy will continue their work as developers on ACF as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Although Kevin Hoffman only joined us last August, he has made a huge impact on WP Migrate and Better Search Replace as product manager. I’m very pleased to say that he will continue that work partnering with Phil Webster and Ahmed Hussein. He will also continue working with Ian Jones and Erik Torsner on WP Offload Media and WP Offload SES.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Touesnard said support teams for each product will remain in place and the plugins&#8217; developers will continue helping out in support as issues are escalated to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Engine has promised to honor ACF Pro lifetime licenses and Touesnard said the company &#8220;has no plans to change subscription prices for any of the plugins for the foreseeable future.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 02 Jun 2022 15:04:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"WordPress.org blog: The Month in WordPress – May 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12993\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/06/the-month-in-wordpress-may-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11823:\"<p>WordPress has a lot to celebrate this month.

Automattic reports that the company received feedback from developers and site owners asking for the ability to use specific components of Jetpack as part of their own &#8220;tech stack&#8221; of plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The six features that are now available as individual plugins include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Jetpack Backup</strong><br />Real-time site backups on Automattic’s cloud infrastructure</li><li><strong>Jetpack Protect</strong><br />Scan for vulnerabilities in WordPress core, themes, and plugins for free</li><li><strong>Jetpack Boost</strong><br />Improve site speed and SEO for free in just a few clicks</li><li><strong>Jetpack Social</strong><br />Automatically share new posts and products on social channels for free</li><li><strong>Jetpack Search</strong><br />Help visitors find what they are looking for</li><li><strong>Jetpack CRM</strong><br />Streamline communication, provide better customer service, and grow sales</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Three of those plugins were already available as separate plugins (Backup, CRM, and Boost). The Protect, Boost, CRM, and Social plugins are free to use. Backup and Search require a paid plan in order to work. Jetpack representatives <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jetpack/status/1532021172627550209\">confirmed</a> those three plugins fall under the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/detailed-plugin-guidelines/#6-software-as-a-service-is-permitted\">WordPress.org guidelines</a> for SaaS connection plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>For years developers have criticized Jetpack for being &#8220;bloated,&#8221; bundling too many features. In 2019, Jetpack acknowledged that the plugin had a discovery problem, where users who were not fully familiar with the plugin&#8217;s dozens of modules ended up installing plugins to perform functionality that Jetpack already includes. Automattic attempted to solve this by <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-is-promoting-paid-upgrades-on-plugin-search-screen-wordpress-plugin-team-says-it-may-be-a-violation-of-directory-guidelines\">promoting paid upgrades as feature suggestions on the plugin search screen</a>, a controversial move that violated the plugin directory&#8217;s guidelines and was promptly <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-7-2-1-removes-promotions-for-paid-upgrades-from-the-search-screen\">reversed</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea behind splitting out more features into individual plugins is that Jetpack users will be able to install only what they need instead of assuming the overhead for the all-in-one plugin. This is also a strategic change for Jetpack as it attempts to market its bulk licensing options for <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/for/agencies/\">agencies</a>. A more modular Jetpack will be more appealing to developers and Automattic plans to split out more features into individual plugins in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Over time, the products that exist as individual plugins may be extracted from the original one, but no matter which plugin you start with, the experience of adding features will be seamless,&#8221; Automattic growth marketer Simon Keating said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The five million Jetpack users who are using the all-in-one-plugin will not experience any changes as the result of today&#8217;s news. As more features become individual plugins, users will still be able to install what they want from a single interface.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 01 Jun 2022 21:01:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"Gutenberg Times: Museum of Block Art is Open for Submissions!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=21239\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/museum-of-block-art-is-open-for-submissions/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2975:\"<p>After launching the <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/introducing-the-museum-of-block-art-moba/\">Museum of Block Art</a>, a community project showcasing the power of the block editor and dedicated to pushing the limits of WordPress, folks began asking how they could submit their art pieces.

The company recently <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/03/lottiefiles-gets-37m-to-make-the-animation-format-even-more-ubiquitous/\">raised $37M</a> in a Series B round, passed three million users on its website, and is investing in making motion design more accessible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lottie&#8217;s open source animation file format is used by more than 135,000 designers and developers in websites and apps for Amazon, Google, Spotify, Microsoft, TikTok, Netflix, BBC, Uber, and other high profile companies. The JSON-based format was created by the design team at Airbnb and grew in popularity because of the small file size (600% smaller compared to GIFs), the fact that it is scalable at run-time, and its flexibility to be used across any platform. Lottie files can be used on iOS, Android, web and React Native without modification. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>LottieFiles&#8217; new WordPress plugin is available for free on WordPress.org. Once the plugin is installed and activated, it will prompt you to sign into your LottieFiles account or a create a free account. You will also be given the option to share the account with other users and copy Lottie files to the WordPress Media Library.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin was made for the block editor. Inserting the LottieFiles block will launch a modal window where users can browse recent, featured, and popular Lottie animations. Users can also search through LottieFiles&#8217; library of more than 50,000 animations or access private files from their accounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the benefits of using the plugin, as opposed to simply embedding an animation, is that the block settings allow users to easily adjust the Lottie size and background, along with the speed, looping, and controls display.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Although block libraries like Kadence Blocks have <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/kadence-blocks-2-2-4-adds-lottie-animations-block\">support for Lottie animations</a>, LottieFiles&#8217; official plugin is a single-block plugin and includes more block controls. It offers one of the most user friendly ways to insert animations into web pages, blog posts, or any content that could use a little a little motion design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The LottieFiles team has been responsive on the support forums and in the reviews so far. In one instance where a user <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/a-number-of-issues-4/\">reported</a> that the plugin adds its CSS on every page in the front and backend, instead of conditionally adding it when Lotties are displayed, the plugin&#8217;s developers said they are working on minimizing the CSS added to pages. LottieFiles is accepting bug reports and feature requests on their <a href=\"https://feedback.lottiefiles.com/plugin-wordpress\">feedback site</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 01 Jun 2022 02:44:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"WordPress.org blog: People of WordPress: Dee Teal\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=12946\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/05/people-of-wordpress-dee-teal/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12388:\"<p>In this series, we share some of the inspiring stories of how WordPress and its global network of contributors can change people&#8217;s lives for the better. This month we feature a WordPress development and large project specialist on the difference the software and community can make to your career and life.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"515\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee-Teal.jpg?resize=1024%2C515&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-12955\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Dee’s story with computers started at school in New Zealand where discovering how a mouse worked and learning BASIC and Pascal was a catalyst for what later became a programming career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a time when computers were just becoming mainstream, there were no opportunities for girls in her school to consider this as a further option. She recalls: “No one thought to say, ‘Dee, you look like you’re good at this, you should pursue it…’. I mean, I was a girl (and I was told girls didn’t ‘do’ computers). No one in the circles I moved in really had any idea where this technology revolution would take us.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With no particular career path into technology, Dee was encouraged in her final year of school to apply for a job in a bank where she worked and became a teller three years later. She gained financial independence, which enabled her to travel as a 20-year-old and spend the next three years exploring the US and Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, she noted how the world had changed: the first computer mouse she had seen had come out in 1983, and 20 years later WordPress was founded.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Journey into coding</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During those 20 years, Dee worked as a nanny, working in child care centers, in customer support, and as a temp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1999, she packed up her bags once again, and moved from New Zealand to Australia. She took a place at a performing arts school where she honed her singing and performance skills and volunteered her time to the music director who was starting to experiment with sending out HTML newsletters and updates via email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And so my personal revolution began. On the day after I graduated from that course, I walked into a full-time role as that music director’s assistant and began my journey back to code.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of that job, Dee edited and sent HTML newsletters on a weekly basis. This ignited her interest in programming, and she bought books about coding for the web and experimented on her home-built PC making web pages. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“I’m sure, like a lot of us, I remember the thrill of creating that first HTML file and seeing a ‘Hello World’ or similar heading rendered in the browser. From there, I was completely hooked.”</p><cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Later she moved to the IT department and took on maintenance of all the websites. By 2004, she was working full-time as a webmaster. A year later, she was running a small business creating sites on the side. Four years after that, her business became her full-time job as she left employment to pursue her Masters Degree in Digital Communication and Culture.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/R0011864.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee with other contributors getting things ready for a WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-12961\" />Dee and other volunteers setting up for a local WordCamp\n\n\n\n<p>Dee found the theory and sociology behind the web, and its facilitation of human and machine communication fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I love the fact that the tech industry involves a constant constant curve of growth and discovery, which results in a perpetual exercise in finding creative elegant solutions for sticky problems.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Dee, being able to use her innate curiosity to leverage processes, people, and tools, fuelled by a focus on communicating a message, has been a defining inspiration in her work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This combined fascination coincided with her meeting WordPress in 2009 and subsequently its community. She moved her existing blog to the software and it became the CMS of choice for all her client work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The WordPress community can change your world</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, she stumbled across WordCamps and by extension the WordPress community. Dee has reflected publicly that WordPress didn’t change her life, its community changed her world!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She flew on a whim from her then home in Sydney to attend a WordCamp in Melbourne she had found after a search for ‘WordPress Conferences’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I met welcoming people, made friends, connected, and came back home excited and hopeful about continuing this connection with the wider WordPress community.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building a community locally around WordPress got off to a slow start in Sydney. From an inauspicious early WordPress Sydney meetup in the function room of a pub, her connection and involvement took off. Before long she was helping organize that meetup, and by the time she moved away from that great city it had branched into two meetups, and soon after, into three.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was so inspired by the community that at the end of that first year and her second WordCamp, she raised her hand to help organize a WordCamp Sydney in 2012, and after moving interstate, WordCamp Melbourne in 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.&#8221;</p><cite>Dee Teal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee said: “WordPress, software, technology, the Internet will come and go, morph, and change, evolve. Maybe WordPress will last forever, maybe it will morph into something else, maybe one day it will look completely different than it did when I first started (actually, that’s true now). The thing that doesn’t change is the humanity around it. WordPress and any other software package exist to serve people.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: “The thing that I have learned, not only through WordPress but in life, is that if we too serve the people around what we’re doing, we ourselves will grow, develop and change alongside the people we serve, and the tools we use to serve them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"329\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/Dee_POW_5.6_slice-large.png?resize=1024%2C329&ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee pictured second from left as part of the WordPress 5.6 contributors\" class=\"wp-image-12957\" />Some of the contributors to the <em>WordPress 5.6 release</em> \n\n\n\n<p>Dee was a coordinator for WordPress 5.6 release in 2020 and was able to encourage others to learn about the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Helping others and sharing knowledge through WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee has been an advocate for cross-cultural collaboration and understanding in both WordPress and her work for a large distributed agency which has people from more than 24 countries and operates across 16 timezones. She has also written about closing the gap between diverse distributed teams and how to meet the challenges of cross cultural remote work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee has given talks at WordCamps, including at WordCamp Europe in 2019, on developing ourselves, our relationships, and our communities in increasingly diverse environments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a strong desire to share her professional knowledge and experience, Dee hopes her involvement in the WordPress community from being part of a Release Squad in the Core Team, and volunteering in the community through organizing and speaking at WordCamp events, will inspire others to get involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&#8220;It’s the connections, it’s the friendships. It’s the network of work, referrals, support, help and encouragement.&#8221;</p><cite>Dee Teal talking about the community that makes WordPress specialbenefits of the WordPress community</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/05/dee-wceu2019.png?resize=1024%2C576&ssl=1\" alt=\"Dee Teal\'s talk at WordCamp Europe 2019 on \'Working a world apart\'\" class=\"wp-image-12958\" /><em>Dee shared her experience with attendees at WordCamp Europe 2019</em>\n\n\n\n<p>In contributing to WordPress and organizing community events around it, Dee found that for her: “At the end of the day it isn’t actually WordPress that matters. It’s those connections, it’s the friendships. It’s the network of work, referrals, support, help, encouragement that has kept me wired into this community and committed to helping other people find that connection and growth for themselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dee’s career in WordPress has moved through coding, into project management of large scale WordPress projects, and now into delivery leadership. Her connections to community have helped &#8216;fuel the transitions&#8217; through these chapters of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said: “I believe that the place I’ve found and the opportunities I have had owe as much to my own desire and ambition as they do to the help, support and belief of the community around me; sometimes even more than I’ve felt in myself.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She feels that she is ‘living proof’ that by helping, connecting, and resourcing other people, you can be helped, resourced and connected into places you had never thought possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has enabled her to reach and have a career in technology that she did not know existed as a teenager playing with that first computer mouse and experimenting with code. Dee hopes her story will inspire others in their journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"share-the-stories\">Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>webcommsat</a>), Meher Bala (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>meher</a>), Mary Baum (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>marybaum</a>), Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>cbringmann</a>), Nalini Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nalininonstopnewsuk/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>nalininonstopnewsuk</a>), and Larissa Murillo (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>lmurillom</a>) for work on this feature.

Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the approach of various mid-year breaks and the prospect of wandering off for some safe, restorative travel, I&#8217;ve been updating my to-read and re-read list. As I was looking at the queued books for my Northern hemisphere summer, there were some common threads, mostly around leadership, but there&#8217;s also like a chunk that&#8217;s about cross-cultural group theory and economics, and then like some beach reads, but there&#8217;s one group in particular that you all might find interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s a group that&#8217;s sort of like a back-to-FOSS basics list. So I&#8217;ll share my top few with you in case you want to pack a copy for your next getaway.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one on our list is called Producing Open Source Software by Karl Fogel. I think everyone who contributes to FOSS projects has received this as one of their first recommendations. Like, y&#8217;all are building open software? Excellent, you need to read Producing Open Source Software. Like, that is just a sentence that comes out of everyone&#8217;s mouths. So this was one of the first open source books that was recommended to me when I joined the WordPress community. It was freshly revised in 2020, and I haven&#8217;t given it a read since then, which is why it is on my reread list this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it shaped the early days of the WordPress project’s leadership, and their lead developers, and some of WordPress&#8217;s basic philosophies. It&#8217;s all available online, under a creative commons, ShareAlike license. And so it&#8217;s worth the read. I&#8217;ll put a link to it in the show notes so it&#8217;s easy for everyone to find in the event that is your preferred beach read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one on this list is a book from Nadia Eghbal. She wrote the excellent Roads and Bridges report that also is probably not light beach reading, but you know, this one is on my list to read this summer because Eghbal always delivers truths about the reality of maintaining popular software, popular, open source software, in a way that&#8217;s easy for me to access and process rather than getting paralyzed by the enormity of it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth your mileage may vary on that. I realized that, like, I live and breathe open source stuff. And so just because I am not paralyzed by the enormity of her explanations of things doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that you will have a similar experience. And so I&#8217;m just going to claim that elephant in the room for all of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you only read one book on this list this year, I think that this should be the one that you read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:14]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third one is called Code: Collaborative Ownership and the Digital Economy. It was edited by Rishab Aiyer Ghosh. I am certain that I butchered that name. And so I apologize on my own behalf to everyone that knows whether or not I said it correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This book focuses on intellectual property rights and the original purpose of having anything like copyright in the world. So, right up my alley! The writers who contributed to this work promise exploration of the plight of creativity in the commons, the role of sharing in creative advancement, and a concept of what it would look like if intellectual property were to mean the second closing of an ecosystem versus a triumph of the commons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, obviously, this one is very light reading. You can take this topic to high tea and everyone will not know what you&#8217;re talking about. However, this one looks like a really interesting book to me and I am just super ready to read it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second to last one on the list is a book called Humble Inquiry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a new-to-me book that seems right in line with one of my favorite books to recommend to leaders in the open source space. From reviews of it, I have gathered that it takes a hard look at the value of listening and asking for clarification in a world that puts a high value on an unsolicited hot take.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It puts the importance of high trust relationship building, which is at the heart of any cross-culturally aware organization. And for folks who&#8217;ve been working with me for a while, you know, that relationship building is an important part of my leadership expectations for myself. So it puts relationship building at the front and center with a promise of practical applications for everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you ever have tried to tackle a complicated topic like this, you know that practical applications are really hard to come by and it&#8217;s often hard to understand it if you don&#8217;t have those practical applications. And so that is why this one is on my read and reread list this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:24]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then finally the WordPress Milestones book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this sounds like a shameless plug for WordPress. And on the one hand, this whole podcast is about WordPress. And so, yes! But on the other hand, I actually am reading this for two specific reasons. I&#8217;m rereading this actually. I read it when I first joined Automattic. And so the first of the two reasons that I&#8217;m rereading it this year is that volume two of this is, like the second decade of WordPress currently, being researched and written in preparation for WordPress’s 20th birthday next year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I am rereading this to kind of get that all back in my mind as that work is getting done. And the second reason is that I honestly like to remind myself of how far we&#8217;ve come sometimes. I talk about our work frequently. And I talk about what we&#8217;re working on right now, all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I talk about what we&#8217;re looking at three years from now, five years from now. The biggest concerns of today, tomorrow, and the future-future. And it&#8217;s very easy to forget how much success WordPress has had and how much growth the contributors that support us have had over the course of our long and storied history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:40]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I like to go back to that just to kind of give myself some grounding in our progress, as well as get some concept for how we can move forward together. So that one is also available online. Also under a creative commons ShareAlike license and it is also worth the read. I will share a link to that with the other one in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. Let&#8217;s see what we got in the old lineup today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, firstly WordCamp Europe is happening this week and it&#8217;s possible to watch the live stream from the comfort of your own home. There are some smart and talented speakers at the event. So I encourage you to catch a few if you have the time. I&#8217;ll include a link to the live stream information in the show notes below, and then also you can always keep an eye out on Twitter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be a lot of discussions, a lot of conversation there. And so you can engage with folks that are there at the time and catch up on those conversations, catch up on those presentations in your own time, as it fits into your day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:50]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WordPress’s community team is preparing the annual meetup survey right now. So if you participate in meetup events, keep an eye out for that because your feedback helps us to make plans to improve that program so that it works better for you. And it helps you to learn WordPress better and feel more confident with what you are taking out into the world that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, if you are wanting to use this as a chance to contribute, we actually will need folks who are able to translate the surveys as well. So I&#8217;ll leave a link to some information about that in the show notes. If all of that stuff about contribution didn&#8217;t make any sense, then just like keep an eye out from your meetup organizer and they will make sure that you have that survey so that you can have your voice heard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then item three is less of an item. I mean, it&#8217;s an item cause it&#8217;s in this list, but it&#8217;s less of, like, a thing to know and more of a general thing to be aware of. It&#8217;s a general awareness item. There&#8217;s a lot going on in WordPress right now. I can see how hard it is to keep track of some of these things these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know as someone who&#8217;s looking at this all day every day that, yeah, it&#8217;s a lot. And it&#8217;s hard to get your bearings. So if you have a team that you contribute to already, don&#8217;t forget to reach out to each other, just to check-in. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to ask for help. Sometimes we don&#8217;t think to offer help and you know, if no one needs any help from you at that moment, a little hello also can brighten someone&#8217;s day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your smallest of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 30 May 2022 17:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Santana Inniss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"Gutenberg Times: Gutenberg Changelog #67 Gutenberg 13.2 and 13.3, WordPress 6.0 and more\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?post_type=podcast&p=21224\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-67-wordpress-6-0/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58930:\"<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack and special guest, Grzegorz Ziolkowski talk about WordPress 6.0 release, Gutenberg 13.2 and 13.3 and interesting discussions happening on the Gutenberg Repo</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Music:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/xirclebox\">Homer Gaines</a></li><li>Editor:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandy-reed/\">Sandy Reed</a></li><li>Logo:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://markuraine.com/\">Mark Uraine</a></li><li>Production:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://icodeforapurpose.com\">Birgit Pauli-Haack</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-21224\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-67-wordpress-6-0#shownotes\">Show Notes</a> / <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-67-wordpress-6-0/#transcript\">Transcript</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\" id=\"shownotes\"><strong>Show Notes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WordPress 6.0 </h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/05/arturo/wordpress-6-0-release-candidate-2-rc2-now-available-for-testing/\">WordPress 6.0 </a>“Arturo” Release post</li><li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/03/wordpress-6-0-field-guide/\">WordPress 6.0 Field Guilde</a> with all DevNotes and changes</li><li>Video: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/oe452WcY7fA\">Release announcement </a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjDhfW7FpAc&t=3s\">Building a site with WordPress 5.0 vs WordPress 6.0&nbsp;</a>w/ Anne McCarthy</li><li><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-video-explores-site-building-progress-from-wordpress-5-0-to-6-0\">New Video Explores Site Building Progress From WordPress 5.0 to 6.0</a></li><li><a href=\"https://pantheon.io/blog/what-expect-wordpress-6\">What to expect from WordPress 6.0</a> by Birgit Pauli-Haack via Pantheon</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Community Contributions</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Plugin: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/core-rollback/\">Core Roll back</a> by Andy Fragen</li><li>Plugin: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/pwa/\">PWA </a>(Progressive Web App)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What&#8217;s Released</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Gutenberg 13.2 </h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/12/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-2-may-11/\">What’s new in Gutenberg 13.2?

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg 13.2 and free WordPress 6.0 and discussions that are taking place and would need your opinion. I&#8217;m Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and WordPress developer advocate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m here today with my special guest and former co-host Grzegorz Ziolkowski, JavaScript developer at Automattic and virtual school contributor. For WordPress 6.0 release co-lead for editor responsible for the merge of the Gutenberg bits and bites into core. Mary Job sends her regards and is taking a break this week. Good evening, Greg. Thank you so much for joining me again tonight. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I&#8217;m great. I&#8217;m so happy that the release went out. Everything works, the work didn&#8217;t collapse, so that&#8217;s great. Also, want to thank you also for being part of the release team and also, I need to mention that I was also a co-lead for the editor with Adam Hevinski, his help was so important to making that happen, because that was a lot of work to bring all the changes from the editor to WordPress core and making sure that everything works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group that helped was so huge. There was, I don&#8217;t know, 20 people, at least helping all the time with different type of tasks, which was an amazing experience to see how everyone cooperates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: And also the release team was much bigger. You and the documentation team also having a core lead like Milana, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Oh yeah. So it&#8217;s really interesting to be part of the team and see how it works. Also, the team was bigger than ever, as far as I know, and I think that it still could be bigger. In my opinion. We have so many tasks that are necessary to make all that happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; I was on the release course now as a rookie and of course I needed co-leads because as a rookie, you don&#8217;t know what to get yourself into. But there are so many pieces that go into this release and it all has been a mystery and most still are mystery to me. Yeah. But I learned a lot. I learned a lot from all of the people on the release squad. But it&#8217;s also the more I know, the more I know what I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s kind of that really overwhelming feeling that, okay, I have watched so many times, but I still had no idea what is really behind it in all the different pieces that are there. So, and as you said, I&#8217;m in awe of all the brilliant people that make these run smoothly and are always there to help each other out. It&#8217;s an amazing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, absolutely. I&#8217;m glad I did it. It was a lot of work and, but wrangling dev notes, it&#8217;s a unique experience anyway. But yeah, congratulations that you helped bring it over the finish line.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, WordPress 6.0, Arturo was released this week named after the contemporary Latino jazz musician, Arturo O&#8217;Farrill with a good Irish name. And there are many features and enhancements that are rolled out with a new version. We talk probably about all of them during the months, leading up to the release on this podcast, we will share again, of course, the release post, and then the field guide with the dev notes. And we will also share two videos with you. One is the release video by the design team. If you haven&#8217;t seen it yet on the about page or in the release post, watch it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a great design and cutting from screen to screen, to highlight all the features that are in there. It&#8217;s a great piece of art, so definitely watch it. And then the second video is by Anne McCarthy and she covered the site building process between WordPress 5.0 and WordPress 6.0. 5.0 was released just to repeat that December 6th, 2018. So it&#8217;s three and a half years ago. And in that video, you&#8217;ll see how it changed from the early versions to how you build sites now. It&#8217;s a great, interesting video to watch. If you haven&#8217;t tried out the block editor yet, if you&#8217;re one who hasn&#8217;t started using it yet, I think you will be surprised, or it&#8217;s eye opening to see how it really changed and maybe it intrigues you to start using it again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s a huge change. How it all has evolved from starting small to edit only the content that&#8217;s post and pages. And throughout all that time, how data change itself, by bringing more tools that are supported and allow you to do more and more things with the content to add some styling and create beautiful designs without using a single line of code. And now even you can create the whole experience. And there&#8217;s many block themes that empower users to edit everything without ever opening and edit or code the detail where you need to deal with PHP files, CSS, and all that big stuff that are becoming more and more complex every year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. And I think the biggest piece that helps a user to one part be in control, but on the other hand, not have to think about too much about design or the block patterns. And I think they have come really a long way from the first idea of a reusable block that people used this kind of templates or block patterns, but then they were changing it and then they changed it over the whole page site. But now combining just core blocks into this amazing designs and design system, it&#8217;s really remarkable. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s definitely part of that show notes today is that video. And we also shared the article that the WP Tavern posted about that. And then just today I found that Pantheon published an article by yours truly like what to expect from WordPress 6.0. And it goes a little bit more on the developer side. And apart from the enhancements, talk about the enhancements for the writing experience. It&#8217;s more about develop oriented, how to code, with code examples for the new pattern features on pulling in patterns from the directory wire theme, JSON Slug, or also create page layouts on the create page action, and then some block locking examples, and also how to establish those style variations in the theme, JSON. So it&#8217;s a little bit different than the release post on WordPress.org. So, Greg, what are the most intriguing features that you found for WordPress 6.0?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: So you already mentioned them, from the coding perspective, you covered how to integrate them on, on the owners of the site. And I think for the user, very exciting possibility is to use style variation when they are provided with theme because everyone have different taste and style variation allow you to quickly change colors, fonts have presets that you can quickly pick one and another, and another until it&#8217;s something that clicks with you and you don&#8217;t have to go and change every setting on the website yourself is just, you have bigger chance to&#8230; The other thing block locking. I think it&#8217;s great and it has a lot of value, but it&#8217;s still missing much more detailed control because everyone can lock and unlock now, which is nice, but you can change that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. But the idea is that in the future, you could have permission-based rules. So, as a site admin, you could just block everything you want for everyone else or whatever else you would like. So this still needs some development, but it&#8217;s the step in the right direction. And also all the work on patterns that how it evolves. You mentioned that how it was limiting and the beginning, and it was introducing with classic themes in WordPress 5.5. And it didn&#8217;t have so much power because for the content of the post, you don&#8217;t use design so often, but with templates, it&#8217;s just so powerful having a way to insert a footer, a header. And now this is even integrated more contextual. If you use this in line inserter and you are on the bottom of the page, it&#8217;ll propose you some footer patterns in other places, it will propose other patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it tries to be smart and help you to do the right choice. So it&#8217;s no longer, only core blocks in those inline researcher, but also patterns. And yeah, in general, I really like how all the concepts that we already know, they build on top of each other that you mentioned reusable block. So you can now do sort of magic things. You find the block pattern you like, you convert that to reusable block and suddenly you have something you like, and it syncs with all other places the same applies with template parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can pick from the block directory pattern of footer and just magically it&#8217;s there and synced suddenly with all other places. So I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing more and more things like that, so people no longer have to worry that they open a new template or new post and they see blank canvas and they don&#8217;t know what to do. Now they open an inserter. There is so much inspiration in there and that you&#8230; it&#8217;s just a different experience. It&#8217;s so much easier to create the same website that you see on the themes demo side than it was before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, well said, Greg. That said, I also like the writing experience. So the favorite feature that I have, it&#8217;s not a big deal, but it&#8217;s actually helping, when you are doing a lot of in-line linking you have the two square brackets, and then you get a list of all the latest posts or pages that you&#8217;ve had. And then you can do in in-line linking for your site. And before you had to kind of look for that and search for it, and what&#8217;s the name of it? And you had to go out and then you had this. Yeah, so this is really nice. And I liked all those keyboard shortcuts that make it, I don&#8217;t have to change from keyboard to mouse and have a very smooth experience yeah. So 6.0 is out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: It&#8217;s definitely for experienced users because there are lot more gems like that. Once you discover you never want to go back and you use all the methods. But it takes time, but&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. And then the same, what trips me up. So the WordPress had this for a long time that when you have a highlighted text, and if you have a see a link on the browser and you copy the link and you highlight text, and then you can just Ctrl V you can actually, it uses the URL as a link on that highlighted text. That trips me up everywhere else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Especially, so I know that GitHub took it over. Yeah, now when you want to highlight, or have a link there, you highlight the text on that. You have to URL Ctrl V works. Yeah. That&#8217;s really cool. And I use a user note taking app called LogSync. They have taken that on too, but the Google docs, every link I put in Google logs, I have to do twice because it just over click. I can&#8217;t do it anymore. It&#8217;s just so interesting. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Another experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Google docs get on it. We need that there too. Yeah. So another experience that I had during the WordPress 6.0 release cycle, during the beta and release candidates, I used a great plugin that I want to do a shout out for. And it&#8217;s called the Core Rollback Plugin. And it was created by Andy Fragen, who is a long time contributor to WordPress and also part of the beta tester plugin crew. And it allows me to select all the WordPress versions back to 4.0 and install it on a test site. So I was able to test the upgrade from 4.0.23, to 6.0, and does it work or does it bomb?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then at first I was a bit disappointed because when I started it, I had a block theme enabled. And of course, then I can only have a WordPress version that actually can handle block theme. So I was only rolling back to 5.9, which didn&#8217;t help me much, but then I realized that, okay, I needed to change the theme. So I changed it to Twenty Ten theme. And then the other part was, how do I get to 4.0? I also needed to change the PHP version to 5.6 and I lose local WP. So that was really interesting. And then it took me maybe a minute or two to install the old version and then upgrade was WCLI to the next version. And that was so fast to test. And then I just went into the site again and did a comment or something like that, just to make sure it works. But that is really, it was very helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m sad that I didn&#8217;t know about it before, because sometimes when you had a WordPress install and the new version came out and you were way on the cutting edge, you had a plugin conflict or something like that. And then how do you roll it back to the previous version? And this plugin will save you so much time and headaches. So just make it sure that&#8217;s in your toolbox when you manage other people&#8217;s websites, because it can really help you with that, go back to the safe version within five minutes or so. And wait, the next two weeks till the next version comes out from workers. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s also fascinating that warper still supports some old version that to get it working, you need to use PHP version that is no longer even developed like 5.6. But still, if people have that, they can use WordPress, which is mind blowing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. It totally is. And I think Serge is watching that percentage of users that still use PHP 5.0 very closely, because I think it&#8217;s going to be real soon that WordPress is going to skip it and say, &#8220;okay, yeah, from now on, we are not supporting 5.6 anymore. You got to have to be on 7.4&#8221; or something like that, but it&#8217;s that promise of backwards compatibility and not kicking users out just because they don&#8217;t know they are hosting environment that still uses these old PHP variations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, but this were two interesting weeks. So we had not only WordPress 6.0 come out, but in the last two weeks, we also had two plugin releases. One was 3.2 and the other one was 3.3 and we will cover them both today. So let&#8217;s get started. So Gutenberg 3.2 was released on May 11th and it had a few new features in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One was the new preference, persistence API, and we are also happy that it&#8217;s there. Now. It saves now the editor preference in user meta, not in local storage anymore for that the preference handling needed to be revamped before. So we talked about it a little bit in the last episode, but now it&#8217;s here in Gutenberg 13.2. So you won&#8217;t see the welcome guide. You dismiss the welcome guide and it will remember on the site. If you prefer the top toolbar, it will remember. And if you don&#8217;t like the full screen anymore, it will remember, but only on a site basis. So you can access the same site over and over again. And the user settings will be there for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. It might be also per editor screen. I mean, if you are on the edit site page might be different and on edit post page or widget page could be different. I don&#8217;t know, because I didn&#8217;t play with that, but I would expect that to happen this way, because in the past, those changes were independent, but it&#8217;s a huge change. We waited for so long to make it happen. It wasn&#8217;t a trivial task, but we finally have that. And it&#8217;s a huge improvement for all users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, definitely for new users and long time users. Yes. I probably will miss the welcome guide popping up once in a while&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: And you can always enable it. There is a setting.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. So in that version also received a visualizer for the panning and margin of all blocks. So when you use the dimension settings of your block, blue outline appears on the screen around the block and expands and contracts, depending on the width of your padding and your margins. And that is really helpful for people that don&#8217;t know what padding and margins are, but they know they want the distance and they want the distance inside or outside. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: The other change was for the comment query loop. So there is a new block, which is post comments form. And the idea was to reach the alt experience. When on the post page you would have comments section, which usually is a list of comments and there is also the form. So the form was missing. And now inside the editor, you have something that isn&#8217;t interactive, but just presents a preview of what you will see on the front end. So it&#8217;s on the front end, of course, there will be interactive form that you can use to comment on the website, which is a great change. And that brings the feature priority with the old approach that we had in WordPress 5.9 with the post comments block that is now hidden from the insert it&#8217;s still there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the idea is just to combine those blocks together in the future. So depending on what you use, what the team prefers, whether the new version of the comments log which allows you to move all the pieces around the rapid with group blocks, with all the blocks you can imagine within its template. And the old one is still based on PHP functions that all team authors know from the past, you can provide your own template with template PHP file. There is a lot of hooks, all the things. So I&#8217;m looking forward to see that combined to have a full experience for all the use cases we have for the classic blocks and for the new blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; No, it&#8217;s wonderful. And I, there were about 10 new blocks coming to 6.0, with a common section. And this one, unfortunately it didn&#8217;t make it, but it&#8217;s coming then in 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: No we made it, it was so important to bring the same experience that we added that, that was still during beta phase because, the release happens, but that change was already one or two weeks ago so that there was still time to include that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Oh, okay. Excellent. So there&#8217;s a full common suite. Suite of blocks for, for the common settings for themes and templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. It also came from user testing during beta phase that people were complaining that they cannot replicate, their old designs without this block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. So makes sense to backboard it to 6.0 yes. So we talked about the next version of the quote block and the next version of the list blocks are in experimental stage and you have to switch them on through the experience menu item on the Gutenberg plugin. And now with this release, the quote block version one now has the feature that you can exit the block just by hitting enter we know this from other blocks that works here with the list you have to hit enter twice, out of the block and then a paragraph block and the code block has now too, before you actually had to physically get out of the block by using the mouse or hitting tab or something like that. Yeah. So that&#8217;s really good. So explain to me, Greg, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re here. Explain to me, so I&#8217;m at the block API section where now it&#8217;s allowing the custom domain path for the view scripts, assuming that&#8217;s through register that&#8217;s for blocks and that you can have a different path than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. So that&#8217;s coming, if you ever build the theme or plugin, there is this domain pet metadata field that you can provide. It&#8217;s just when you are using translations, there is a default folder for that inside every WordPress, but as an author of the theme, you can generate all the translations yourself and put it in every folder you want. So because plugin, authors and team authors use that, we added a change that allows to provide the same type of functionality when you are registering view script, it&#8217;s mostly for plugin and team authors. And when they, if they want to have some special JavaScript code that is for many blocks, they add additional functionality, then it&#8217;s going to be useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Excellent. So I know there was something important, but I couldn&#8217;t explain it. Thank you. What&#8217;s also in 13.2, is that the style engine now added typography and color to the back end for the editor so you can, can add it to the block styles and is it for the blocks, Jason, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. As far as I know the study in gen, at least at this stage of development, it&#8217;s mostly about extracting existing code to something that in the future could evolve into something more sophisticated. So it&#8217;s more on the refactor side for now, but it&#8217;s a preparation for bigger things that we have planned for the future with having unified of way of the handing styles for blocks on the PHP and JavaScript side to ensure that it&#8217;s the same on both sides and in the future, we can do interesting things, we will cover that probably with the next release, it might be going in the next release. So one of the changes that recently landed in the Gutenburg is that because of the style in gen, you can only serve CSS styles for blocks that are actually displayed on the page, which is mind blowing that you can can think about all the savings you have because of that, because you exactly know, not only the blocks you used, but also what type of styles were enabled for those blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that&#8217;s the biggest win for this whole refactoring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. There&#8217;s a whole discussion about, is of one of the implementation about standardizing, how themes interact with the styling of the blocks and as well as plugins. And I think that&#8217;s also necessary to standardize that in terms of when, when plugins want to introduce new blocks, they need to be able to use the variables that are introduced with the theme JSON file to just seamlessly integrate with, with an existing theme. Yeah. So what&#8217;s, I&#8217;m really sad to see that go. But what was removed was the experimental PWA support for the WP admin, which pretty much was playing around with the idea that you might get an offline and still would be able to write your post and manage your site. There was an experiment by Ella Van Durpe I think. And I think it was a good experiment, but it wasn&#8217;t pursued any further because of course, had other priorities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: But there is PWA plugin from Google and you can also check it out and it has a lot of similar functionality but for the front end, which is also a nice thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Excellent. Yeah. And I will dig that up and show it in the show notes link in the show notes, the Google PWA plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes. And one interesting, I think from the release and being on the team, so together with Adam Janinski, we work on several improvements to the workflow of bringing code from the Google plugin to WordPress core. And we are using NPM packages as a way to share code from Gutenberg and use that directing core. And we introduce a change in workflow that is automated with GitHub actions. So if someone is using GitHub and actions that they know how powerful those tools are. And now we are tagging for the WordPress major release those packages and we can easily update all of them, by using only the distribution tax, little change in the code, but it simplifies so much things inside WordPress core and how the code is shared between those two code bases, which is quite interesting. Someone wants digging into strategies for managing deep projects. I recommend that reference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. you should write about those little tools or little ideas that make such a difference on the release of WordPress, because I can see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Oh yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; That other people can really benefit from that. But I think it takes a little bit more strategic approach than just a PR that it has been in the release. Yeah. And the Gutenberg release. So that would be really great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting because usually the code you need to write is the easiest part because all the tools are so advanced these days, Github has APIs tools for that. And so it&#8217;s not an issue to code something. The issue is to come up with all the steps, what needs to happen after what, so it works together. So we definitely will be updating documentation for the release team for future releases, how we use the tools we improved and yeah, also for NPM packages, that&#8217;s also something I plan to write to describe how the process has changed with this release and to benefit everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, definitely. So I found with the release that quite a few things have been done by the same people over and over again. Yeah. So the documentation is kind of the shortcuts for them, but if a new person would step in, then it kind of needs a little bit more flesh and strategy kind of yeah. High level information in there. Yeah. So what&#8217;s again, is there anything else in Gutenberg 13.2, we wanted to talk about? I guess that&#8217;s it for 13.2 and we are going right into Gutenberg release 13.3, that was released yesterday. Ryan Welcher wrangled the release over the finish line and posted the release notes. There are comments from 55 contributors among them with their first time contribution. Yay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s really good. I was really amazed at the 6.0, sorry. Just digress again. Those WordPress 6.0 release was interesting that there were also 25% of the 500 plus contributors when new contributors, they had never done this before. So it was very interesting. It wasn&#8217;t, as I think previous releases 5.8 and nine were a little bit higher, but still, that&#8217;s a very high number of new contributors and&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, the number of contributors is really interesting thing we know for Gutenberg about people who contributed with scope. It&#8217;s now over 900 people and, it&#8217;s only code and there&#8217;s so many more people that help with testing with finding issues, trying to, provide designs, documentation. That&#8217;s a lot. And for core, we don&#8217;t know the exact number for all releases because we have core commuters. So which is a smaller group, like 60 or 70 people only. But I would love to do to get the exact number of people who ever got props for WordPress core, that would be a huge number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, must have been in the tens of thousands of people there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, and you said it right. It&#8217;s not only those people that commit code, but it&#8217;s also those who, who argue about the best features, how to approach it. Yeah. and comment on things or review PRs or patches. So yeah. It must be a huge number and it&#8217;s still a huge number if you also consider the people that write documentation, the people that organized meetups, the people, they alone, 780 meetups in the world. Of course, the last two years, they were a little bit crippled because of the pandemic situation, but they will come up again and organizing months over months of meet up Wordcamp meet up, Wordcamp organizers that it&#8217;s just really amazing, people that test things. There are 20 different themes on make.wordpress.org that people could join and see what they can do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you want to do something, just a little pitch here, it&#8217;s the end user documentation team still needs writers. They triage a lot of things and all in GitHub now where you can look for the first night issues, good first issues that you could start writing and help beef up the documentation. And if you are interested in doing just that, feel free to write to me or ping me on slack or on Twitter. And I&#8217;ll have you get onboarded on that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Gutenberg 13.3</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, let&#8217;s dive into 13.3 release. So the first thing is you can now transform a cover block into a media text block and keep most of the design too. And that&#8217;s fantastic. Because sometimes you want to do that and you couldn&#8217;t. So you had to delete the cover block and start all over again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s really intriguing how far you can go with transform these days and also how block adjust, because now it&#8217;s not only content, but also a lot of styles and those styles are also, taken from one place from version to another, which is quite a complex thing to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. I tested it in WordPress 6.0 there is this feature where you can transform from a paragraph into a quote block or a list block. And it also keeps background color and text color. And it is really amazing. Yeah. And this transformation from cover to media text did not make it, but it&#8217;s now in the Gutenberg plugin,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I&#8217;m a little bit surprised to see that, but also it&#8217;s a great news that table of contents block is back in the Gutenberg plugin. I mean, it was disabled at some point because it&#8217;s hard to sell. I mean, it wasn&#8217;t ready for pride time for some reasons, but now it&#8217;s back and it&#8217;s still experimental. So that means it still needs some testing, but it&#8217;s really nice, especially for posts where you have a lot of headings because it automatically generates tables of contents, how the name says. And because of that, you will have a nice overview of what&#8217;s inside the post. And it&#8217;s also super handy to be able to go to the section when the post is very long. So that should have a lot of usage on some websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. And it automatically detects your headings and creates if they&#8217;re not already in there anchor links for them. That&#8217;s how it works. So you could also use the same anchor links if you want to link from outside of the post, into the post to a certain section. So that&#8217;s definitely a nice side effect for that. And it also does it, if you have on page breaks, it detects the heading over all the pages. And it also can jump from two headings that are on subsequent pages for that post. So it&#8217;s quite sophisticated in the feature set. One feature set that I&#8217;m actually missing is that it automatically creates the table of content as a numbered list. And I have never used a number table of content on a website. So it was always in a bullet list, but I cannot change it back into a bullet list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you have to do is to kind of create a static block out of that. And then it does a bullet list. But it does not update anymore when you add a heading. So then you have to delete it and start all over again. So that&#8217;s a little bit cumbersome, but I think I will file a feature request for that to have it as a real feature I advocated for it, but it didn&#8217;t make it in the first version. So what&#8217;s also interesting actually in this release is that the post terms, you can now add dynamic variations for custom taxonomies. So when you have the post term block, it kind of also lists every taxonomies that are registered with your site. And then the other part, what I really like is that query loop block now has a parents filter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you&#8217;re working with, with a page, you can now use the parent filter to display content from the children of a particular parent page, which eliminates the need for a plugin again. Yeah. I think I need to count all the plugins that I have that I won&#8217;t use anymore because work has it built in, and the place on a list of the sub pages, or you can, even if you have featured images with it, you can even make some nice cards with that on the parent page and show up the next subsequent pages. At the agency. We had quite a few requests for that because some people couldn&#8217;t rock the post kind of post page thing and they always want the pages that&#8217;s so static. They never change, but you want them a different path of discovery and not just through the navigation menu, but also through imagery on the page where it can say, &#8220;okay, now you go here, then here and here and here,” it&#8217;s really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s also, the way query loop evolves and how many new features gets with every plugin. It&#8217;s really interesting to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; So let me ask you this, are teams working, or is a team working on the idea that you have a developer ahead who wants to kind of modify the query a little bit more granular than just what you offer through the interface, kind of handled SQL statements or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: So to also support SQL, I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s on the roadmap mostly because it&#8217;s way too complex and you still can go and code yourself something very custom if you want to right? So it wouldn&#8217;t be that hard to replicate, maybe let me put it this way, replace the server implementation of the query loop, the wrapping block and provide your custom query from that. That&#8217;ll be much easier in my opinion than allowing users to start filling with as well and all the square injection, vulnerabilities and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. I hear you. It&#8217;s a small thing, but in the new version, you now have tool tips on the split border radios control. So when you&#8217;re in the sidebar work on the border radios, you actually get tool tips where you are actually working on it. Is it the top part of the border or is it the left or the right part or the bottom part? And that&#8217;s really some quality interface and you can actually have a radio separate. And I didn&#8217;t know that, it&#8217;s kind of here now. You can have a radius control just for the left border. Yeah. It&#8217;s a little round, but the other three, they don&#8217;t have a radius at all. And it makes for nice, interesting forms. Now you can do this with Gutenberg in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I also like the color controls are now merged with a dropdown component that is a little bit more helpful. It shows when you change the background color to a gradient, it now also shows you in the sidebar when you just open it, what is the current color? And it also shows the gradient instead of just the breakdown color. And you surprised that&#8217;s not the background color that I had. It&#8217;s a gradient. And now you see it all. But the color panel has gotten quite complicated as well. With the same with you click on it and then it comes out and then you have two tabs on there, one the solid color, then the gradient color. And then in the gradient, you can then change the radius and it&#8217;s gotten quite complicated. And I can see that certain things take a little longer or need to be tested first with one block before it&#8217;s rolled out to the other blocks yeah. But that makes also for sometimes it&#8217;s not consistent over all the blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. But it also makes a lot of sense to combine all those related tools into one. So the sidebar is not so overwhelming for users. So before we had many colors, if you would open that, a year ago, that would be all those things that you see now in this tool table dropdown, they were inside the sidebar, it&#8217;s just the necessary step to organize all that better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. I like that curation of settings, then there is for each section heading for the color there&#8217;s on the right end side, sometimes a little too subtle, the three dot menu where you can also switch on and off some features. Yeah. By default, you only see the color for the text for the background, but when you click on the three dot menu, you also see that you could actually manage the link color, but it&#8217;s not offered for every block, but you can switch it on if you need it, for instance, for a quote block or for a list block. But sometimes you need to kind of really go beyond the obvious and click on that three dot menu to find additional features that you knew were there before, but now are a little bit hidden. Yeah, that is&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yes, but if you are a new WordPress user, I&#8217;m curious how it works, because it might take some time for people to discover that the three dots actually allows you to enable more controls or remove the controls that are there, but they don&#8217;t like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. So the same&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Feeling of similar changes, there is one, I would say big change because the block list, the thing you see on the sidebar, but the other side, the one we were talking was on the right side. But on the left side, you can see all the list of all the blocks that are on a given page or template. And that&#8217;s very important for the editing experience, especially for templates where there&#8217;s a lot of nesting involved. And now there is an option in your settings to show openly view as default. So before you have to click a button to open that list, but you can just dock it and it&#8217;ll be there all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. I really like that, especially. Yeah, you&#8217;re right. The list view is such an integral part working with templates with all the nested blocks. Yeah. So having that open all the time really cuts down on the load time of the editor and your work workflow when you work quite a few templates or even in, on a normal post. Yeah. But I don&#8217;t think that setting is available for the post editor. I think it&#8217;s only for the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. I don&#8217;t know about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. It&#8217;s only for the site editor it&#8217;s post editor. Well, has that too always open list view. Yeah. So I looked at the preference tables that were in the screenshots. It&#8217;s for both the post editor and for the site editor. Yeah. A lot of people ask me about that when I demoed some of the new features. So what else do we have?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: There&#8217;s there is still no official post with all the change lock files. So we are using something that was prepared earlier. And so we might need to jump a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski:</em> To find other items that we have highlighted today. And one of the change is for the heading block. And now we have font family support there. So it was available in other places now it&#8217;s been enabled there for future party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. And a lot of people have been waiting for that our user can now change the font family for the heading block and not just the theme developer. And there&#8217;s also a enhancement for the gallery block, but especially for converting a classic block gallery into a gallery block to also include the image caption up until now it didn&#8217;t come over with it. So that&#8217;s definitely a plus for those who converting galleries to gallery blocks. Yeah. And the other two things that are highlighted here are actually part of the table of contents block. And we already talked about that. So I think we are through with that. Was there anything in the three 13.3 that you wanted to point out</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: There is a lot of items as you rule in the change logs from two releases. And also we discussed work 6.0. So I think we covered a lot today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. But we didn&#8217;t cover all and we never cover all. So dear listeners, definitely check out the change log that will be on the make.Wordpress.org blog when it comes out as a what&#8217;s new in Gutenberg 13.3. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Discussed and in the Works</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>And we are at the section, what&#8217;s discussed and what&#8217;s in the works that hasn&#8217;t been released yet? But it&#8217;s definitely top of mind and or discussed quite a bit. So there were some discussions on what keeps theme developers or agency developers who build themes for on taking, for instance, block themes or other features of the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those issues come up quite a bit, not quite a bit, but once in a while, and to have some ideas on what would be good for an agency. So one of them was that made it into WordPress 6.0 was for instance, that themes could register blocks. And I think Grzegorz, you were quite instrumental in that to get it fixed or get it implemented that although the recommendation says that blocks are the territory of plugins. But we heard from agencies that we are building custom themes just for that one site implementation that had additional cost also to deploy a theme as well as blocks in plugins to make it available for them. So that was one of the discussions that came out of&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah, also the use case was that sometimes themes require some very custom design and this is a way for them to bundle a block that just is targeting that specific theme. And it wouldn&#8217;t make sense in all, all other places. And, but yeah, it&#8217;s not the recommendation blocks belong to plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, but just because it&#8217;s technically possible, doesn&#8217;t have to be, you have to use it, but it&#8217;s available for those who really, really need it. Now, before they had each agency or each freelancer who needed it, came up with their own hacks to make that. And now it&#8217;s just the standard way of using register block type on the theme PHP theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to alleviate some of the adoption hurdles or blockers for adoption there&#8217;s now a new label on the Gutenberg rebuild called focus blocks adoption. And it&#8217;s used on the Gutenberg repo to identify those specific issues that if they would be solved, they could remove the blockers from adopting blocks or block themes. And I think it&#8217;s an interesting concept now to highlight those one of them is one issue. He got that label is by Fabien who has issues C7943 titled allow the usage of block based template parts without using block based templates. And that&#8217;s an interesting idea for classic themes that want to gradually adopt what&#8217;s possible now with the site editor also for their themes and how to implement that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And part of it is already Grzegorz told me, and Ari has it in the issue is already available since 5.9. But what this particular issue is talking about that it also activate the site editor to edit those template parts without editing any other templates or sections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. So idea was that if you have a classic theme, you can also provide a template part HTML file that will contain this template particular template part, and that worked, but you wouldn&#8217;t be able to edit that. But the proposal is to open the UI for the same, that is inside in block themes for classic themes, which is an interesting way might be a challenge. But the more we open those solutions for classic themes, the better everything becomes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. And it follows the narrative that Matias actually had when he joined us here at the show, after he published the preliminary roadmap of 6.0, when he said that all the things that come with the block theme are not there necessarily to replace how themes work. It&#8217;s more to expand the reach that classic themes can offer to their users or the site owners. And I really like that narrative because it kind of, has that new can come in, but in piece and bits and you don&#8217;t have to adopt it completely, it&#8217;s a gradual adoption. And even in two or three years, you still have a need for classic themes, but there might be a need to open that up for some of the user controls or for the site owners controls. So yeah. Block themes are not replacing or making themes totally redundant. It&#8217;s actually opening up the whole place for new things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: It also opens an interesting world where you have a block theme, but you&#8217;ll like it, you could switch to the classic block and still retain template parts that you build in your previous theme, it&#8217;s WordPress, everyone can do whatever they like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. And now you can do even more and you didn&#8217;t know that you liked it. Yeah. Like gradients.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then another discussion that came up now that 6.0 is out Matias Ventura, the lead architect also updated already some of the tracking issues. And I&#8217;m sure there is a new blog post in the making in outlining the roadmap for 6.1. But he already has a site editor and template roadmap tracking issue about 19 tasks. And that&#8217;s about the site editor and how to create template and template parts changes to the interface or updates to the interface to make it for impossible, to edit a template part properties and focus mode. What is a focus mode? It&#8217;s another way of seeing the editor. There&#8217;s also a browse mode coming to the site editor that you look at it from, you just browse the designs, but you&#8217;re not editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah. And other things like restricting block editing capabilities, we talked about the block locking at the beginning of the show that comes in 6.0, and that is now that needs to be expanded on. You mentioned that it needs to be role based of course, but also you probably want to lock down the editing part of a footer or header that people can edit it. Not just remove it or move it, but also not edited that is still missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are quite a few in this tracking issue, hints of what&#8217;s to come. And if you&#8217;re curious, we of course share the link in the show notes and what he did for template for the site, edit 10 templates, roadmaps Matias Ventura also published a global style, ongoing roadmap that he updated. And that covers some of the style engine that we talked about. If you want to learn more about it, also the main interface for making changes to the global styles, browsing styles, without having to edit things, web fonts that would just have the web fonts for the style variations right now. But the big part of the web funds API didn&#8217;t make it into 6.0, but it will hopefully make it into 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: Yeah. Also interesting discussion on Twitter where Matias were involved about the future of web phones that maybe openverse could host some web phones and having those open source version of phones, integrated with the WordPress for everyone. That&#8217;s also interesting perspective and general openverse opens so many new ways of reusing content created by other people, which is images, videos, music, and whatever&#8230; Phones. That would be another way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, and color palettes would actually be also quite interesting. Yeah. So you can swap out the color palette of your theme and just by bringing it in from the openverse. Yeah. Oh, did you see that there&#8217;s a new contributor batch if you added photos to the openverse, to the WordPress photo directory, you can now see that on your profile. Open verse open so many different things for WordPress. It&#8217;s amazing, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I already have this batch. I just checked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah me, too</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: I Uploaded two photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. I think I uploaded four or so but yeah, it doesn&#8217;t matter. It&#8217;s a contribution and it will be honored. Yeah. So you have the site editor, the template, the global styles tracking issue. And then the last one is pattern as the section elements. That&#8217;s kind of the next phase for patterns and interesting proof of concept there&#8217;s first a tracking issue. And then James Costa has quite a few little videos and what he kind of considers as a browse mechanism for where you can browse through certain block patterns for the header, for instance, but you see the full page and that will make working on their site so much easier when you&#8217;re actually not only just looking at that section, that&#8217;s visible in your screen, but you can see the full page. And that&#8217;s also available for posts, for instance, or for pages that you create. So there are quite a few things in the works that hopefully make it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: It, the idea for those sectioning element is really interesting. You mentioned that you can just have the recent exploration is to have zoom out mode. So, you focus on the header and then you get ways to quickly switch the versions of this header by using block patterns or maybe pre-existing template parts, and you just use arrows or something else depending, or how you use that. And how&#8217;s going to maybe implement, and it just quickly switch to another version. Another, until you find something that clicks for you, but it&#8217;s inside the page. It&#8217;s not that you open a model, then you see only just some preview of these things, but you exactly see how it fits to your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah, and so we will share the links to those comments and PRs in the show notes. And if you&#8217;re interested in where things are going, definitely look at those and see what it does for you. And if you have ideas, how it&#8217;s made better or what does not look right or how it can be augmented. Yeah. Chime in now is the time because now people are working on it. And the last discussion that I wanted to point out is that during the FSE program Anne McCarthy did a hallway hangout to talk about the FSE programs and how it works and all that. And then there&#8217;s an issue created or it&#8217;s not an issue, it&#8217;s a discussion post on the developer experience category on the GitHub discussions. And what the full site editing for agency use case is what are the existing features that work that are available and then what are missing features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then as well as the features that can be improved, for instance, as a missing features, it identifies the robust permission system for the template editing, as Grzegorz mentioned earlier, or another one is allow editing for only template parts or only specific template parts, but not other parts or other templates that is much more granular. Another interesting thought was that WordPress inland CSS does not always respect the editor font sizes. That might be a bug, but it could also be that some of the mechanics don&#8217;t work as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that comes all out of a hangout meeting, which is a hallway hangout meeting is kind of an informal meeting of brains, people that discuss certain things. And this came out of it. I shared the hangout notes, hangout recap, post by Anne McCarthy, as well as this discussion at the GitHub repo. So for all you interested people. All right. So Gregorz, we are at the end of our show. I&#8217;m so glad that you were able to jump in for Mary Job this week and walk us through some of the things. Thank you so much.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</em>: That was a pleasure to meet with you again and talk about Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>:&nbsp; Yeah. And as always the listeners, the show notes will be published on Gutenbergtimes.com/podcast.

The blog where he shared his thoughts on life and tech was starting to get more traffic and he wanted to ensure its future after the b2/cafelog&#8217;s main developer disappeared. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg had the vision for what WordPress should be, even before it had a name. It centered on extensibility, a hallmark feature that has made the platform as popular as it is today:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>What should it do? Well, it would be nice to have the flexibility of MovableType, the parsing of TextPattern, the hackability of b2, and the ease of setup of Blogger.</p><cite>Matt Mullenweg &#8211; <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/\">The Blogging Software Dilemma</a>, January 24, 2003 </cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Textpattern, the interesting new publishing tool at the time, had everything Mullenweg might want in a blogging tool, he wasn&#8217;t sure about its licensing at the time. He decided to fork b2/cafelog, which lives on today in a different form as WordPress, thanks to its GPL licensing. Mike Little joined the effort and the rest is history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The highlight of this year&#8217;s anniversary celebrations is the <a href=\"https://wp19.day/\">wp19.day</a> website created by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/dimensionmedia/\">David Bisset</a> and his daughter<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemonadecode\"> Olivia Bisset</a>, who also managed the project. WordPress users and contributors from all over the world left their heartfelt greetings to celebrate the occasion. Reading through, it&#8217;s easy to get a sense of the tremendous good WordPress has done for the world, giving so many a voice, a livelihood, and a chance to live their dreams.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The wp19.day website also featured video submissions from WordPress enthusiasts. Although many first came for the software, the common thread among those who have stayed is the value of the community that has grown up around the project and the leadership it has cultivated. WordCamp and meetup organizer Joe Simpson said WordPress empowered him to take a leadership role in his local community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our community here is nurturing &#8211; it&#8217;s a family,&#8221; Simpson said. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited to see where we go from here. Happy birthday, WordPress.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg also joined in the fun of celebrating the milestone by contributing his own greeting to the wp19.day project. In his video submission, he said it&#8217;s very rare for a 19-year-old software project and its community to not just still be surviving but actually thriving and &#8220;doing better than ever.&#8221; He thanked contributors of all kinds who have helped people find their way with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\nMatt Mullenweg on WordPress&#8217; 19th Birthday &#8211; video source: <a href=\"http://wp19.day\">wp19.day</a>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;That is a testament to every single person who has ever told a friend about WordPress, participated on the forums, had a translation, contributed code,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Anything that&#8217;s been part of the WordPress ecosystem is part of why WordPress is transforming the web and making it into a place that is more open, more inclusive, more democratic, and a place that we want our future generations to grow up in.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 27 May 2022 22:12:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"Post Status: WooCommerce Function of the Week: add_fee\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=98289\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://poststatus.com/woocommerce-function-of-the-week-add_fee/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:321:\"Before we dive in this week\'s function, please note that it\'s usually against any payment provider\'s Terms of Service (like PayPal\'s) to add fees to a transaction based on the customer\'s chosen payment gateway, so please make sure to use &#8220;cart fees&#8221; in a legal way.

It is perfect for longform content that is organized by multiple headings within the document. The block automatically detects Heading blocks within the content and will display them with anchor links that jump to each section.</p>\n\n\n\nTable of Contents block &#8211; video credit: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/05/26/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-3-0-may-25/\">Gutenberg 13.3 release post</a>\n\n\n\n<p>Users may select the block without knowing how it works with headings. If the post or page doesn&#8217;t contain any headings, the block inserts a message prompting users to start adding Heading blocks in order to display a Table of Contents. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>For sites that have registered custom taxonomies, Gutenberg&#8217;s Post Terms Block now automatically generates a block variation for each term. That means users can select a block to display all the terms associated with that custom taxonomy.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Other notable additions in 13.3 include the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Query block now supports a &#8220;parent&#8221; filter that will display content of children from the defined parent</li><li>Heading block now supports Font Family controls</li><li>Save Block List default view preference &#8211; allowes users to set a preference for having the Blost Lick view open or closed by default</li><li>New transforms between the Cover and Media &amp; Text blocks</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest release also brings dozens of enhancements and bug fixes to preferences, border controls, error messages, tooling, accessiblity, and performance.

And there is no built-in way to disable the ones you don’t use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we will show you how to easily disable RSS feeds in WordPress, including options for disabling individual RSS feeds. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Are RSS Feeds?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Really Simple Syndication or Rich Site Summary (RSS) is a type of web feed that enables subscribers and applications to receive real-time updates from a website. In simple words, it lets you offer your users an ability to automatically receive your new content via RSS feed reader, email newsletter, and other apps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With RSS feeds, you can offer your readers an ability to automatically receive and read your new content in their email, feed reader, and other devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some WordPress plugins use RSS feeds to add additional features. These are features  such as the ability to receive new comment notifications, receive new post notifications for specific categories or author, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite all the important use-cases of RSS feeds, sometimes you may want to disable RSS entirely. Or if you&#8217;re concerned about SEO crawl cleanup issues, then you may want to disable certain types of RSS feeds which aren&#8217;t as useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Should You Disable RSS Feeds in WordPress?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress enables different RSS feed types by default. Unfortunately, you don&#8217;t need them all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the most common RSS feeds you&#8217;ll find in WordPress include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Global RSS feeds (content feeds)</li><li>Global comments RSS&nbsp;feeds&nbsp;</li><li>Individual Post &amp; Pages feeds</li><li>Author feeds</li><li>Taxonomy feeds</li><li><span style=\"font-family: var(--font-family); font-size: var(--font-size); color: initial;\">And more</span></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is that these extra feed URLs are included on your website pages. This leads to search engines like Google to burn through your website crawl quota. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a website with a lot of pages, then this can slow down your website&#8217;s indexing rate and hurt your overall discoverability in search engines. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases, you may just want to disable the RSS feeds entirely because your website is static and does not have a blog component. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of your use case, we will show you how to disable RSS feeds in WordPress, the easy way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Disable RSS Feeds in WordPress (The Easy Way)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to disable unnecessary RSS feeds is by using the <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/pricing/\" title=\"Pricing\">AIOSEO plugin</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All In One SEO is a powerful <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/best-seo-plugins-for-wordpress/\" title=\"6 Best SEO Plugins for WordPress in 2022 (Tried and Tested)\">WordPress SEO plugin</a> trusted by over 3 million savvy website owners to help boost their rankings.

They are any part of a URL after and including a question mark (?), ampersand (&amp;), percentage sign (%), equals sign (=) or other attributes (markups) added to a URL. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s an example of a URL with a parameter:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>https:&#47;&#47;www.example.com/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=tweet&amp;utm_campaign=spring-sale</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>URL parameters are also known by many other names. Examples include query arguments/query args, query strings, URL query parameters, URL params and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What are URL Parameters Used For?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>URL parameters have many different uses depending on their purpose. One of their primary use cases is to pass information to webmasters about a URL’s clicks. This helps them get valuable metrics about its performance. Other common uses include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Filtering</strong>: For example, filtering different product pages.</li><li><strong>Organizing</strong>: You can use URL parameters to organize content on a website. Organizing content into categories, for example.</li><li><strong>Tracking</strong>: Tracking parameters are useful for monitoring the performance of marketing campaign sources (especially for referral traffic). They also help attribute conversions.</li><li><strong>Search parameters</strong>: Often denoted by the letters “q” and “s,” search parameters help organize and return results for search queries.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to Find URL Parameter Spam in Google Search Console</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite URL parameters being useful, there are some situations in which they aren&#8217;t. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most common is crawl spam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crawl spam happens when users and search engines perform certain actions on your site. These actions can result in parameters being added to URLs which can impact your overall crawl quota. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The screenshot below shows an example of URL parameters as you would see them in Google Search Console Coverage report.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"719\" height=\"496\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/delete-url-parameters-gsc-screenshot-edit-2.png\" alt=\"You can use Google Search Console to discover the URL parameters on your site.\" class=\"wp-image-98032\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/delete-url-parameters-gsc-screenshot-edit-2.png 719w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/delete-url-parameters-gsc-screenshot-edit-2-300x207.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/delete-url-parameters-gsc-screenshot-edit-2-600x414.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides search engines and legitimate users, URL parameters can also be created by malicious agents. This happens when a bad actor wants to overload your site with meaningless URLs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, all these types of URL parameters can quickly inflate the number of URLs associated with your site. This results in crawl and indexing issues. When this happens, it leads to poor discoverability on search engines, and it can result in less organic traffic to your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it&#8217;s URL parameters you created or those that are out of your control, managing them is critical for your SEO success. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why Delete URL Parameters From Google Search Console?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being useful for some, URL parameters can cause problems for SEOs and webmasters. That’s why you must be careful to only use them on pages that benefit from them. This is because URL parameters can lead to: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Duplicate content</li><li>Dilute search rankings (due to keyword cannibalization)</li><li>Wasted crawl budget </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, URL parameters can cause major SEO problems. Therefore, you may want to delete those that don’t add value to your and your users&#8217; experience.&nbsp;Doing so will <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/seo-checklist/\">boost your SEO</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Delete URL Parameters the Easy Way in WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you know the pros and cons of URL parameters, the next step is to manage them in a smart way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 1: Install AIOSEO</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing you need to do to manage URL parameters and improve WordPress SEO is to install and activate the <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/pricing/\">AIOSEO plugin</a>. All in One SEO is the best WordPress SEO plugin used by over 3 million smart website owners to help improve search rankings.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/pricing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"311\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/adding-seo-keywords-aioseo.png\" alt=\"AIOSEO is a powerful tool that makes it easy to delete URL parameters from Google Search Console.\" class=\"wp-image-96547\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/adding-seo-keywords-aioseo.png 700w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/adding-seo-keywords-aioseo-300x133.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/adding-seo-keywords-aioseo-600x267.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>AIOSEO comes with all the powerful features that you need to set up your SEO settings the right way. For example, it can help you easily deal with URL parameter spam along with many other SEO growth tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information on how to install and activate AIOSEO, <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/docs/installing-all-in-one-seo-pro/\" title=\"Installing All in One SEO Pro\">check out our installation guide</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have activated AIOSEO on your WordPress website, you can easily fix the URL parameter problem by using the powerful <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/introducing-crawl-cleanup-and-importing-urls-from-a-csv-file-to-your-sitemap/\">Crawl Cleanup feature</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crawl Cleanup enables users to delete URL parameters safely and mitigates the risk of breaking your site while doing so.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 2: Activate Crawl Cleanup In AIOSEO</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To activate Crawl Cleanup in AIOSEO, simply head over to <strong>AIOSEO » Search Appearance</strong> menu, and then go to the Advanced Tab.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, scroll down to the bottom until you find the <strong>Crawl Cleanup</strong> toggle.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/e9VeiXKfSJZeBCw-00FZqA2sx02nPU5k31sHTo9gXskhPzkBjt6cTE21gcgatXKaNNXg_pM1qU4yoP3_G752-ayZc_MMoQVHCOKcE1aoTFICKIoQsmCmgw5yeT7A6DdOR-9mQpGsqoiMg2jOag\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When to switch the toggle to activate Crawl Cleanup, you’ll be presented with options for managing your URL parameters. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"205\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/delete-url-parameters-activate-crawl-cleanup.png\" alt=\"Crawl Cleanup gives you more control over your URL parameters.\" class=\"wp-image-97499\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/delete-url-parameters-activate-crawl-cleanup.png 700w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/delete-url-parameters-activate-crawl-cleanup-300x88.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/delete-url-parameters-activate-crawl-cleanup-600x176.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to select the option to Remove Query Args and toggle it to Yes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>AIOSEO will also recommend removing individual RSS feed and other various feed types by default because they all impact your coverage report.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 3: Determine the Parameters You Need</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next step in deleting URL parameters from Google Search Console is to determine the parameters you want to delete. Remember, URL parameters should only be used when they serve a function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, during the life of a web page, so many parameters can be added that sometimes outlive their purpose. For example, if you switch from using session IDs to cookies, tracking parameters become redundant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, the bulk of unnecessary URL parameters that can bog down your site aren&#8217;t the ones you create. It&#8217;s mostly those that arise from user and search engine activity on your site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why you must audit your URLs to check for unnecessary parameters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few tools you can use for this include Screaming Frog and Google Analytics, among others. Use these tools to filter your URLs by searching for those with the “?” attribute.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"496\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/delete-url-parameters-ga-report.png\" alt=\"Tools like Google Analytics can help you identify unnecessary URL parameters on your website.\" class=\"wp-image-97536\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/delete-url-parameters-ga-report.png 496w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/delete-url-parameters-ga-report-300x212.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 496px) 100vw, 496px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Once done, you can download a CSV file of all the URLs with parameters. Go through your list and determine those you should delete.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Step 4: Allow the URL Parameters You Need</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Armed with your list of useful (and unnecessary) URL parameters, you can now go on to delete the unwanted ones. To do this, simply add the parameters you want to allow in the <strong>Allow Query Args</strong> field:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"860\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/delete-url-parameters-allow-query-args.png\" alt=\"AIOSEO enables you to easily delete URL parameters.\" class=\"wp-image-97502\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/delete-url-parameters-allow-query-args.png 860w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/delete-url-parameters-allow-query-args-300x122.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/delete-url-parameters-allow-query-args-768x313.png 768w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/delete-url-parameters-allow-query-args-600x244.png 600w\" sizes=\"100vw\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve added all the URL parameters you need, click <strong>Save Changes</strong>. Crawl Cleanup will then delete all other unlisted parameters on your site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although AIOSEO settings will fix the issue immediately, it will take anywhere from 1 week to a couple of months for the changes to reflect in your Google Search Console depending on how large your website is. However you should be able to see weekly progress inside your Google Search console.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Deleting unnecessary URL parameters will result in better crawling and indexing of your website. It will also lead to more accurate reports on Google Search Console. As a result, you&#8217;ll have a clearer picture of your website’s performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, deleting unnecessary URL parameters <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/ultimate-wordpress-seo-guide/\">boosts your SEO</a>. This is because your essential pages will stand a better chance of being indexed and ranked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides deleting URL parameters, Crawl Cleanup can also help you <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/disable-rss-feeds-in-wordpress/\" title=\"How to Disable RSS Feeds in WordPress (Step by Step)\">control your RSS feeds</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"591\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/delete-url-parameters-rss-feeds.png\" alt=\"Crawl Cleanup also helps you manage your RSS feeds much better.\" class=\"wp-image-97542\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/delete-url-parameters-rss-feeds.png 591w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/delete-url-parameters-rss-feeds-300x178.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope this article helped you delete unnecessary URL parameters from Google Search Console and fix other crawl spam issues in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have made a great decision to start using AIOSEO to improve your rankings.

This is done to increase the search engine rankings of that page and the website as a whole. The more quality links a page has, the more authority it has. Other benefits of link building include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/10-methods-to-generate-organic-traffic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Drive organic traffic</a></li><li>Boost brand awareness</li><li>Enhance your user experience (UX)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s why we’ve compiled this link building guide — to help you build strategic and relevant links that will result in some major SEO wins. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Understanding the Different Types of Links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we dive into our top link building strategies, let’s briefly look at the different types of links you should know as you build your links.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Internal Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Internal links are links from one page on your site to another (or vice versa). These are usually underrated but play a massive role in SEO. For example, internal links help:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Users and search engines find content on your site.</li><li>Spread link equity (PageRank) from one page to another, boosting your website&#8217;s domain authority (DA).</li><li>Define your site architecture.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of their importance, being strategic in your internal link building is crucial.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Outbound External Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Outbound external links (outbound links) refer to those links from your website to other websites. These are mostly used to add context to content by pointing readers to a resource that delves deeper into a particular topic. On the SEO front, they help add credibility to your content and make it authoritative. This is essential to meeting <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/what-is-google-eat/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google’s E-A-T standards</a> for high-performing content.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Inbound External Links (Backlinks)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Inbound External links, also known as backlinks, are links from another site pointing to your site. These are considered the most valuable types of links as they are a vote of confidence in your content, both to search engines and users. As a result, the more high-quality backlinks you build, the higher your chances of ranking top on search engine results pages (SERPs).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What about Nofollow and Dofollow Links?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;You’ll have to understand the difference between nofollow and dofollow links as you build outbound links to and from your site. You also have to know when to use each.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what’s the difference between nofollow links and dofollow links?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically, there’s no such thing as a dofollow link. By default, all links are dofollow unless otherwise changed. This means search engines will follow them unless you add a rel=nofollow attribute. As long as you don’t add the rel=nofollow attribute to an external outbound link, search engines will consider it a vote of confidence from you. The reverse is also true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about nofollow links?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A nofollow link is a link with the rel=nofollow attribute.

It also helps you easily identify orphaned posts so you can add links to them.

Whichever way you opt for, Link Assistant speeds up your internal link building and makes it much easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/how-to-use-link-assistant-to-optimize-your-internal-linking-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Optimizing your internal links</a> is much easier when using Link Assistant.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Determine Your Ideal Website Structure</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One internal link building best practice to follow is to determine your <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/website-architecture\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">site architecture</a> beforehand. This simply means how your website is organized. Proper site architecture results in the optimal layout of information and provides for a positive (UX). In addition, this makes your site easily accessible to users and search engines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you create the best site architecture for your website?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few tips for doing that include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Keep your top-level navigation simple.</li><li>Use a simple URL structure.</li><li><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/breadcrumb-navigation-in-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Use breadcrumbs</a> to make navigating back and forth easier.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding your site architecture is essential in helping you know how to strategically link to important pieces of content on your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this brings us to the next point.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Identify Your Pillar Content and Build Clusters Around It</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another critical element of building internal links is to identify the pillar content on your site. Pillar content refers to the most critical content on your site that covers a topic extensively. You can then create separate pieces that cover each main point in-depth. These are called child pages, and you can create links from child pages to pillar pages and vice versa. You can also create links between child pages. These result in clusters around your pillar post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is this internal linking strategy important?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the most important reasons include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Helps search engines better understand what your website is about, resulting in <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/index-your-website-on-google/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">better indexing</a>.</li><li>It’s essential to building authority.</li><li>Improves UX as users can easily find more information on a particular topic.</li><li>Improves the quality of your content.</li><li>Makes content planning and creation easier and faster.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All these result in a boost in SEO as it results in you ranking for more keywords. And with Google favoring authoritative content pieces, especially for <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinessdevelopmentcouncil/2021/11/02/what-you-should-know-about-ymyl-in-seo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">YMYL websites and pages</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ensure Your Links are Contextual</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every time you create a new post, you should link it to all other posts on your site, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big no!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Proper internal linking requires that your links be contextual. This means every link you create must be to a topically relevant page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s called is contextual linking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Link building should never be random. It must be strategic. A huge part of that involves ensuring that you link to pages that add value to your content. Doing so will result in a well-organized website that search engines can easily index. It also leads to a website users can easily navigate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Careful with Anchor Text</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As you build your internal links, you’ll have to be careful about your anchor text.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is anchor text?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anchor text is the clickable text in a hyperlink. <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/seo-tutorial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Like this</a>, for example.  Here&#8217;s a better example of good anchor text usage:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"182\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/link-build-ng-strategies-anchor-text.png\" alt=\"Pay careful attention to anchor text when building links.\" class=\"wp-image-96567\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/link-build-ng-strategies-anchor-text.png 700w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/link-build-ng-strategies-anchor-text-300x78.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/link-build-ng-strategies-anchor-text-600x156.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The keywords in your anchor text are vital as they help search engines and users know what to expect after clicking the link. For this reason, you must carefully craft your anchor text. Examples of how to do so include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Be descriptive</strong>: Your anchor text must describe the topic your link leads to.</li><li><strong>Must be natural</strong>: Don’t force links into your content by twisting the anchor text to accommodate the post you want to link to. Place your internal links naturally into your content so that it both flows and adds context.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Avoid clickbait</strong>: As much as you may want readers to click on your link, avoid using click-baity anchor text. This is anchor text that promises something readers won&#8217;t find when they follow the hyperlink.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, avoid optimizing your anchor text by using your focus keyword in every hyperlink. Doing so can lead to you being penalized.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Building Backlinks&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the three main types of links to build on your site, backlinks probably impact your ranking the most. However, not all backlinks are created equal, so it’s not a matter of getting as many of them as possible. Instead, you must build quality backlinks that are relevant to your niche. This will increase your chances of ranking well on SERPs and driving more organic traffic to your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, in a competitive niche, the number of links pointing to your page must be high to ensure your content ranks well. This will help increase your page authority, thereby boosting your SEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you build many quality backlinks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some white hat techniques anyone can implement, even beginners.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Publish High-quality Content</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best ways to build backlinks organically is to publish high-quality content. Publishers are always looking for quality content to link to enhance theirs. Therefore, investing in great content should be central to your content marketing strategy. Not only does it help you establish yourself as an authority, but it also helps you with organic link building. Examples of this type of content include long-form guides, how-to articles, and expert interviews, among others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides quality, you should also ensure that most of your content is evergreen content. This means timeless content. Creating evergreen content will result in that piece of content attracting backlinks for as long as it’s live.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Create Link Magnets</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone loves linking to helpful resources in their content. That’s why one of the best ways to build high-quality backlinks is to create link magnets. These are any types of content that other publishers will want to link to organically. Some examples of link magnets include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Industry research</strong>: This is one of the best backlink magnets, as every publisher looks for proof to validate a point they make in their content. Unique industry research does just that. As a result, people will link to it.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Stats posts</strong>: Like industry research, statistics posts attract a lot of backlinks as they help validate content.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Case studies</strong>: Because they help readers see how a product or principle works in real life, case studies are another linkable asset you should create.</li><li><strong>Tools and cheat sheets</strong>: Creating resources that people can use to solve a problem is another excellent way of attracting backlinks. Website owners or admins will link to these to add value to their content.</li><li><strong>Infographics</strong>: This content type is popular for presenting content simply and visually.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The type of link magnet you create depends on your target audience and what they deem valuable content.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Have a Guest Posting Strategy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Guest posting is another fantastic link-building tactic you should employ when building backlinks. Guest posting refers to the practice of creating content to have it published on a site other than yours. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/drive-organic-traffic-guest-post-1.png\" alt=\"Guest posting is a fantastic way of building backlinks and driving organic traffic to your site.\" class=\"wp-image-91672\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/drive-organic-traffic-guest-post-1.png 700w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/drive-organic-traffic-guest-post-1-300x130.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/drive-organic-traffic-guest-post-1-600x261.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Most publications will allow you to link back to your site in the content itself and the author bio. A few tips for running an effective guest posting campaign include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Target relevant sites</li><li>Guest post on high-quality sites</li><li>Create super helpful content</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do this, you will earn a backlink from each site you publish on. It will also result in referral traffic from those sites, a boost in brand awareness, and more. That’s why guest posting must be a deliberate part of your digital marketing strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Conduct Link Building Outreach Campaigns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Outreach campaigns are another powerful link building technique to add to your bag of tricks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is a link building outreach campaign?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Link building outreach campaigns are the practice of reaching out to publishers to obtain a backlink. However, with so many requests for backlinks, a simple ask won&#8217;t be enough. To help improve your chances of building high-quality backlinks through outreach campaigns:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Check Your Competitors&#8217; Backlink Profile</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best places to start when designing a link building outreach strategy is to check out your competitors. Use tools like <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/recommends/ahrefs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ahrefs</a>, <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/recommends/semrush/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Semrush</a>, and others to see who’s linking to them. These make good targets as it shows they can link to you too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Craft a Compelling Pitch</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When pitching sites for backlinks, don’t send generic emails. Craft a unique and compelling pitch that offers value. If the publisher can see that giving you a backlink will also benefit them, the chances of you getting the backlink are higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, remember to personalize each pitch for the recipient and their audience. Even if you’re using a template, take time to tailor it to the website you’re targeting. You’ll have to research each website, contact person, and audience to pull this off. Doing so will help personalize everything from the subject line to the content to the offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Only Reach Out to Relevant High Authority Sites</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Search engines are smart. They can tell whether a link is relevant to your topic, niche or industry or not. If it’s not, it won’t count when ranking your site. That’s why building irrelevant links is a waste of time, effort, and resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the most out of your link building campaign, always target relevant sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides relevance, aim for authority sites. These are sites that have a high domain authority (DA) on Ahrefs or domain rating (DR) on Moz. The higher a site’s DA or DR, the more impact a backlink from it has on your ranking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While all this may seem like a daunting task, it’s pretty easy if you use the <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/top-tools-link-building-get-quality-backlinks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">right link building tools</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Build Broken Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Building broken links (also known as link reclamation) is similar to the link building outreach approach discussed above.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Broken link building is the practice of searching for dead links on other sites in your niche. The purpose of this is to pitch a replacement link from your site, thereby earning you a backlink. Don’t worry. This isn’t as difficult as it sounds, especially if you use the right <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-backlink-checker-tools-compared/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">backlink checker tools</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few tips to help you leverage this link building strategy include:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Look for Competitors’ Broken Pages</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Using tools like Ahrefs, conduct a <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/how-to-do-an-seo-competitor-analysis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">competitor analysis</a>. Look for competitors&#8217; pages with broken links that have external links pointing to them. Because a website is a living document, you’ll likely find these as content is usually deleted, moved, or replaced. If they forget to redirect them, this results in 404 pages. Every site that linked to this page would benefit from a replacement link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>FYI, if you want to find and fix 404 errors on your site, AIOSEO can help you do that. This is all thanks to our <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/features/redirection-manager/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Redirection Manager</a>. To get started, go to the Redirects tab in your AIOSEO settings. If it’s your first time using this feature, you’ll be asked to enable redirects.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"378\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/how-to-move-a-wordpress-website-to-a-new-domain-redirect-1.png\" alt=\"AIOSEO\'s Redirection Manager can help you find and fix 404 errors on your site.\" class=\"wp-image-70171\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/how-to-move-a-wordpress-website-to-a-new-domain-redirect-1.png 700w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/how-to-move-a-wordpress-website-to-a-new-domain-redirect-1-300x162.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/how-to-move-a-wordpress-website-to-a-new-domain-redirect-1-600x324.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Once redirects are enabled, the next step is to enable 404 logs. AIOSEO will start logging 404 errors on your site when you do this.

Once you have found these pages, you have two options:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Recreate a better version. This involves creating new content tailored to the page you want to obtain a backlink from.</li><li>Find a replacement page on your site. If you have a similar page, simply pitch that instead of creating a new resource.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, you must have a replacement resource to pitch.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Vet the Opportunities and Pitch</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve compiled a list of broken competitor pages and the sites that linked to them, the next step is to vet your opportunities. The main criterion to use here is the quality of links pointing to the broken page. If the links are of good quality, then, by all means, pursue them. To do so, you must pitch your resource to the websites that have linked to your competitors’ broken pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantage of this strategy is that no one wants to link to a broken page, as it’s not good for SEO and UX. As a result, most publishers would gladly accept your offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: you can also use this strategy for outdated content, not just broken links.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Create Expert Roundup Posts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Expert roundup posts are another fantastic opportunity to build high-quality links to your site. One reason for this is that roundups are excellent ego bait. People love sharing about themselves, their businesses, and their strategies. As a result, they’ll gladly participate in your roundup. And when they do, chances of linking back to that post are pretty high. For best results:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Research influencers and experts in your niche</li><li>Check if they link back to similar resources</li><li>Reach out to those that actively participate in expert roundup posts</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating roundup posts is an excellent way of building relationships with other bloggers, influencers, and subject matter experts (SMEs) in your space. These are relationships that can prove invaluable in future link building campaigns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another variation of this tactic would be to pitch your blog posts to publications that curate weekly or monthly roundups of the best articles on a particular subject. One of the easiest ways to find such publications is to use Google. To do this, use the “intitle:” or “inurl:” search parameters together with the phrase “link roundup.” Here’s an example of the results you’ll get:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"462\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/link-build-ng-strategies-roundup-posts-1.png\" alt=\"Performing a search with parameters such as &quot;inurl&quot; will help you find websites that publish roundup posts.\" class=\"wp-image-96743\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/link-build-ng-strategies-roundup-posts-1.png 462w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/link-build-ng-strategies-roundup-posts-1-300x227.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 462px) 100vw, 462px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Reach out to publications that publish roundups that feature your type of content and pitch your best content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Leverage Barnacle SEO</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Barnacle SEO is a link building strategy that takes advantage of the authority of top-ranking websites for highly competitive keywords. Like a barnacle, you attach your website to these larger websites (whales) and leverage their authority to rank for your focus keywords.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few ways to leverage this tactic include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Get featured on partnership pages</li><li>List your business on business directories</li><li>Publish on social media platforms like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Quora</li><li>Get listed on review sites</li><li>Guest blogging and roundup posts</li><li>Leverage publishing platforms like Medium, Business2Community, Wikipedia, etc.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For this strategy to work, make sure the sites you’re targeting are not direct competitors. You also need to target relevant sites that attract visitors that fit your target audience’s profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Avoid Toxic Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all backlinks are good links. Some are toxic links that can negatively impact your SEO. Two classic examples of these are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>PBNs</strong>: Public blog networks (PBNs) are a network of websites created with the sole purpose of linking out to other websites to boost SEO. Because these are unnatural links, they’re not a recommended way of getting backlinks. Also, most have low-quality links.</li><li><strong>Paid links</strong>: Buying links is a practice that is frowned upon by search engines. If you have paid links on your site and they are discovered, you could get penalized. As a result, your rankings will take a dip.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To avoid unnatural links, carefully audit all your links regularly to ensure you have a healthy backlink profile. If you find spammy sites linking to yours, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2648487?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">disavow them in Google Search Console</a> immediately. Unnatural links are usually a sign of black hat SEO tactics. While these may bring you fast results, you may pay dearly down the road, especially when Google rolls out an update clamping down on such tactics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Building Outbound External Links</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we’ve covered internal and inbound links, let’s quickly look at how to build outbound links strategically.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, linking to another website is a vote of confidence from you. It’s also a great way to boost your content’s authority. That’s why you must carefully build your outbound external links. Some tips to help you do so include:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Choose Your Sites Carefully</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When linking externally, make sure to link to reputable and trustworthy sources. Linking to disreputable sources will result in you losing credibility. It may also result in poor rankings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing to consider as you link to a source is whether or not that site is the original publisher of the fact or stat you’re sending readers to. This ensures 100% credibility. If you can’t find the original source, your next best bet is to link to a reputable source that cites the fact. If you go that route, it’s advisable to use a nofollow tag, so search engines don’t associate the site with your content. If you&#8217;re an AIOSEO user, this is easy to do. Simply add your link and set it to &#8220;nofollow&#8221; as shown below.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"432\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/link-build-ng-strategies-add-no-follow-1.png\" alt=\"Adding a nofollow tag is easy with AIOSEO.\" class=\"wp-image-96742\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/link-build-ng-strategies-add-no-follow-1.png 432w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/link-build-ng-strategies-add-no-follow-1-300x243.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Use Proper Anchor Text</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your anchor text is important as it helps both users and search engines know what to expect behind the link. That’s why you must make yours as descriptive as possible. Avoid anchor text like “click here” and its variants.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Only Use Helpful Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you add an external link, consider whether it’s useful to readers or not. Don’t just link to add external outbound links to your content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you only add links to game the algorithm, you’ll end up with a page that doesn’t offer a positive user experience. As a result, you’ll lose your readers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Don’t Link to Competitors</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While this may seem obvious, it still needs to be stated — don’t link to your competitors. Doing so will be detrimental to your SEO and business. Instead, look for research articles and sources that aren’t your direct competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Make Sure You Set Your Link to Open In Another Tab</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you add an external outbound link to your piece of content, always make sure it opens in a new tab. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"352\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/link-build-ng-strategies-open-link-in-new-tab.png\" alt=\"Setting links to opemn in a new tab is a link building best practice to follow.\" class=\"wp-image-96564\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/link-build-ng-strategies-open-link-in-new-tab.png 700w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/link-build-ng-strategies-open-link-in-new-tab-300x151.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/link-build-ng-strategies-open-link-in-new-tab-600x302.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Doing this gives users more control of the experience as they can easily navigate between your site and the external one you directed them to. It’s also good practice, resulting in readers staying on your site longer. In addition, this helps you improve important SEO metrics like dwell time, time spent on page, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Link Building Takes Effort and Careful Planning, But It’s a Must</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to rank well on search engines, you must include link building in your overall <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/seo-tutorial/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SEO strategy</a>.

But you probably have some questions regarding the move. Here are six of the most commonly asked questions we&#8217;ve received from users who&#8217;ve reached out to our support team:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Does AIOSEO have a canonical URL option for Woocommerce products like Yoast does?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, AIOSEO outputs canonical links for WooCommerce products. Moreover, you can specify your own canonical URL for any item of content. You can find this setting by editing your content and scrolling down to the&nbsp;<strong>AIOSEO Settings</strong>&nbsp;section and clicking on the&nbsp;<strong>Advanced</strong>&nbsp;tab.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. I use the Yoast SEO free plugin. Do I need to remove it before installing AIOSEO? Will any of my Yoast SEO settings be preserved when I install AIOSEO?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you will need to deactivate the Yoast SEO plugin&nbsp;<strong>once you&#8217;ve activated</strong>&nbsp;All in One SEO because activating two SEO plugins at the same time can cause critical SEO issues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can import your settings and SEO data from Yoast SEO by going to&nbsp;<strong>All in One SEO &gt; Tools &gt; Import/Export &gt; Import Settings From Other Plugins</strong>. All of your Yoast settings will get migrated to All in One SEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have an article on <a href=\"http://- https://aioseo.com/docs/importing-settings-from-other-plugins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">how to do this here</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. I have a multi-location business, and I’m thinking of switching from Yoast to AIOSEO. Does your Local Business SEO feature support multi-location businesses?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, AIOSEO Pro supports multiple locations for the Local Business SEO feature. If you have a multi-location business, AIOSEO can help you get those different locations listed in local search results.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our Local Business SEO add-on outputs structured data markup. This is a type of code (known as&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://schema.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Schema.org</a>) that provides search engines with detailed information about your business&#8217;s multiple locations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Search engines may use this code to display rich results in some cases. These may include information such as your address, phone and email contact information, opening hours, and other useful information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have covered this in our documentation here:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-aioseo wp-block-embed-aioseo\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"DntPD01h5F\"><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/docs/local-business-seo-for-multiple-locations/\">Local Business SEO for Multiple Locations</a></blockquote><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Local Business SEO for Multiple Locations&#8221; &#8212; AIOSEO\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/docs/local-business-seo-for-multiple-locations/embed/#?secret=BdQKwmOXZU#?secret=DntPD01h5F\" data-secret=\"DntPD01h5F\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. I’m using WordPress version 4.9.18 and the Yoast SEO plugin. I can’t update WordPress because of custom work and compatibility problems but I want to migrate to AIOSEO. Is it compatible with older versions of WordPress?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All in One SEO Pro is fully compatible with WordPress 4.9 or later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the minimum requirements for AIOSEO Pro :</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>WordPress version 4.9 or later</li><li>PHP version 5.4 or later</li><li>All in One SEO is compatible with PHP up to and including version 8.0.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can safely purchase and install All in One SEO Pro on your site, and that should not cause any issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, you can easily migrate all your existing data from Yoast to All in One SEO Pro by following this documentation:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-aioseo wp-block-embed-aioseo\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"i1G2utaJUh\"><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/docs/importing-settings-from-other-plugins/\">Importing Settings From Other Plugins</a></blockquote><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"&#8220;Importing Settings From Other Plugins&#8221; &#8212; AIOSEO\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/docs/importing-settings-from-other-plugins/embed/#?secret=kB8M7qAaPp#?secret=i1G2utaJUh\" data-secret=\"i1G2utaJUh\" width=\"500\" height=\"282\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. How does AIOSEO compare to Yoast? If I have Yoast should I remove it or can both run together or is that overkill?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many differences between Yoast and AIOSEO. Here are several articles which compare the two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will find that AIOSEO offers more features to improve your search ranking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the answer is comprehensive, feel free to read the articles below. They&#8217;ll help shed more light on some of the features that make AIOSEO stand out from Yoast:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/yoast-seo-vs-all-in-one-seo-which-is-the-best-seo-plugin/#yoast-seo-vs-all-in-one-seo-which-is-best\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Yoast SEO vs All in One SEO: Which Is Best?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/yoast-seo-vs-all-in-one-seo-which-is-the-best-seo-plugin/#seo-audit-checklist\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SEO Audit Checklist</a></li><li><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/features/indexnow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IndexNow</a></li><li><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/yoast-seo-vs-all-in-one-seo-which-is-the-best-seo-plugin/#additional-seo-tools-and-features\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Additional SEO Tools and Features</a></li><li><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/yoast-seo-vs-all-in-one-seo-which-is-the-best-seo-plugin/#paid-plans-and-pricing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Paid Plans and Pricing</a></li><li><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/yoast-seo-vs-all-in-one-seo-which-is-the-best-seo-plugin/#yoast-seo-vs-all-in-one-seo-support\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Yoast SEO vs All in One SEO Support</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you decide to go with AIOSEO, we don&#8217;t recommend running Yoast simultaneously. This is primarily because activating two SEO plugins can cause critical SEO issues, as both the plugins will output their own meta tags. This will lead to duplicate metadata.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. I want to take advantage of Google’s Structured data, Google’s Knowledge Graph and some features like Yoast Local. I’m a Yoast user but find the plugin to be too expensive for me and want to switch to AIOSEO. Can AIOSEO help me with this?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, our plugin adds Schema structured data markup for Google Knowledge Graph and articles, breadcrumbs and local business SEO. You can get more information&nbsp;<a href=\"https://semperplugins.com/documentation/adding-schema-org-markup-for-rich-snippets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">in this document</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ready to Make the Switch From Yoast to AIOSEO?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope this helped you understand how to migrate your SEO settings from Yoast SEO to All in One SEO.

Regular maintenance also enables you to spot problems early before they develop into something more complex and unfixable, and to avoid common system mishaps and failures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article will highlight different ways to ensure that your site is well maintained so it keeps performing optimally. Proper WordPress website maintenance should also be an essential element of every <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/ultimate-wordpress-seo-guide/\" title=\"Ultimate WordPress SEO Guide: Optimize Your Site in 2022\">SEO strategy</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-aioseo-theme-notice-box\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;You must, at the very least, have admin access to your dashboard in order to&nbsp;install the necessary plugins and make the required changes to properly maintain your site.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>8 WordPress Website Maintenance Tips Every Site Owner Should Follow</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of your WordPress site as a machine — it needs regular maintenance to ensure that it runs optimally. Here&#8217;s a list of things you must regularly do to ensure your site operates at its optimum level.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Create Backups of Your Site</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before making any changes to your site, you need to ensure that all of your data&nbsp;is backed up securely. Backing up data is often overlooked but nonetheless&nbsp;a necessary precaution to avoid common misfortunes. Think of this as a safety net to protect all of the&nbsp;hard work and money you invested in your site. Whilst it may seem burdensome at the time, you will thank yourself later for having taken the time to do it properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a number of ways in which you can securely back up your data. One of the easiest ways is to use&nbsp;one of the many quality backup plugins (free and paid) available in the WordPress Plugin Directory. <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/recommends/backwpup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">BackWPup</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/vaultpress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">VaultPress</a> are both&nbsp;popular and reliable plugins, but our preference goes to <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/recommends/backupbuddy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">BackupBuddy</a> from our friends over at iThemes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-image-2951\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/backupbuddy-schedule-1024x512.png\" alt=\"Scheduling database or complete backups is as easy as a few clicks, but BackupBuddy does require a paid license.\" class=\"wp-image-2951\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/backupbuddy-schedule-1024x512.png 1024w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/backupbuddy-schedule-600x300.png 600w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/backupbuddy-schedule-300x150.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/backupbuddy-schedule-768x384.png 768w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/backupbuddy-schedule-500x250.png 500w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/backupbuddy-schedule-100x50.png 100w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/backupbuddy-schedule-150x75.png 150w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/backupbuddy-schedule-200x100.png 200w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/backupbuddy-schedule-450x225.png 450w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/backupbuddy-schedule-900x450.png 900w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/backupbuddy-schedule.png 1069w\" sizes=\"100vw\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The best&nbsp;way to ensure&nbsp;that your data is safely stored is to have&nbsp;automated (scheduled) backups in place. You can automate backups with any of the aforementioned plugins. Yet even with automated backups, you should&nbsp;perform regular testing to ensure that your data is actually being backed up&nbsp;properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to multiple backups, keep your backup files&nbsp;in different places. There are many offsite storage destinations that you can use for free. However, the easiest solution is to use a <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/best-wordpress-backup-plugins/\" title=\"The 7 Best WordPress Backup Plugins in 2022\">WordPress backup plugin</a>. These make backing up your site easy and safe. It also makes for a seamless process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always remember that <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">a full&nbsp;backup is what actually matters</span>. So what constitutes a full backup?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">(1)</span> Your MySQL database (blog posts, pages, comments and&nbsp;your admin preferences)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">(2)</span> Your files (themes, plugins, media, scripts and anything else that adds functionality and structure to your site).&nbsp;That means that in the event&nbsp;you lose your site – knock on wood – you can restore&nbsp;the full backup and you&#8217;ll be good to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Backing up data&nbsp;is an essential step in&nbsp;the entire maintenance process, so do make sure that you take it seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Enable Maintenance Mode for Major Maintenance Work</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One aspect of WordPress maintenance you can’t avoid is <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/how-to-put-your-wordpress-site-in-maintenance-mode/\" title=\"How to Put Your WordPress Site in Maintenance Mode\">putting your site in maintenance mode</a>. WordPress maintenance mode refers to the status you put your website in when making significant changes. This is especially if those changes can potentially break your site or result in a bad experience for users. Putting your site in maintenance mode usually means disabling some functions or blocking some pages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this may sound like a daunting endeavor, it isn’t. There are many plugins available that can help you put your site in maintenance mode. Two of the best are SeedProd and WP Maintenance Mode.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Enabling Maintenance Mode Using SeedProd</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/recommends/seedprod/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SeedProd</a> is a no-code plugin that’s easy to use yet powerful enough for users of all expertise levels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"662\" height=\"442\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-seedprod.jpeg\" alt=\"If you want to know how to put your WordPress site in maintenance mode the easy way, SeedProd is it.\" class=\"wp-image-95618\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-seedprod.jpeg 662w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-seedprod-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-seedprod-600x401.jpeg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the significant advantages SeedProd offers include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Highly customizable</li><li>Custom logo or background</li><li>Email sign-up form</li><li>Social sharing buttons</li><li>Countdown timer</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also configure your maintenance mode so that users can still access important parts of your site. With SeedProd, maintenance mode doesn’t mean closing down shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We strongly advise you&nbsp;to take your website offline during maintenance. Taking it offline will prevent poor&nbsp;user experience (which is vital to SEO, among other factors).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Take Care of Your Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Links play a huge role in how users experience your website. It also impacts how search engines crawl and index your content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s important to ensure that all links work properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As your website grows, this can be quite a daunting task. That&#8217;s because you have to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Finding broken links</li><li>Building internal links </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where SEO plugins like All In One SEO (AIOSEO) come in handy. <a href=\"http://aioseo.com\">AIOSEO</a> is a powerful SEO toolkit trusted by over 3 million websites. That&#8217;s because many smart marketers have seen how the plugin can help them boost their visibility in search and drive traffic to their websites</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"311\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/adding-seo-keywords-aioseo.png\" alt=\"AIOSEO is a powerful tool that makes it easy to add internal links automatically on your WordPress site.\" class=\"wp-image-96547\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/adding-seo-keywords-aioseo.png 700w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/adding-seo-keywords-aioseo-300x133.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/adding-seo-keywords-aioseo-600x267.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>AIOSEO is more than just an SEO plugin. It&#8217;s a powerful SEO toolkit that enables users (even those with no technical knowledge) to DIY most of their SEO. That includes most aspects of on-page SEO, off-page SEO, and technical SEO. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a deep dive into the two main aspects of taking care of your links:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Finding and Fixing Broken Links</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding and <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/how-to-easily-find-and-fix-404-errors-in-wordpress/\" title=\"How to Easily Find and Fix 404 Errors in WordPress\">fixing broken links</a> is super easy with All in One SEO (AIOSEO), thanks to the <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/features/redirection-manager/\">Redirection Manager</a>. This is a handy feature that easily allows you to find any broken links on your page and redirect them to a relevant page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To use the Redirection Manager, you need to <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/docs/installing-all-in-one-seo-pro/\" title=\"Installing All in One SEO Pro\">download and install AIOSEO</a> and get a <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/pricing/\" title=\"Pricing\">Pro or Elite license</a>. Once that&#8217;s done, go to&nbsp;<strong>Redirects&nbsp;</strong>in the AIOSEO menu, and click on the&nbsp;<strong>Activate Redirects</strong>&nbsp;button.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"730\" height=\"398\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/enable-redirects-in-all-in-one-seo-1.png\" alt=\"Activate redirects to use the Redirection Manager. \" class=\"wp-image-37536\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/enable-redirects-in-all-in-one-seo-1.png 730w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/enable-redirects-in-all-in-one-seo-1-300x164.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/enable-redirects-in-all-in-one-seo-1-600x327.png 600w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/enable-redirects-in-all-in-one-seo-1-110x60.png 110w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/enable-redirects-in-all-in-one-seo-1-165x90.png 165w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on why you’re redirecting, you can choose from a range of redirect types. Common examples include 301 (permanent), 307 (temporary), and 302 (found). This will ensure users have a positive experience as they consume your content. It will also help ensure you don&#8217;t get penalized by search engines for broken links.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Building Strategic Internal Link Structure</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Another essential element in WordPress website maintenance is ensuring you build a strategic internal linking structure. Again, AIOSEO makes it easy with the <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/features/internal-link-assistant/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Link Assistant</a> feature. You can find this in the main AIOSEO settings menu or at the bottom of each page when you’re in editing mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"381\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/internal-linking-with-link-assistant-links-report.png\" alt=\"Internal linking plays a big role in good WordPress website maintenance.\" class=\"wp-image-79017\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/internal-linking-with-link-assistant-links-report.png 700w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/internal-linking-with-link-assistant-links-report-300x163.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/internal-linking-with-link-assistant-links-report-600x327.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Link Assistant automates internal link building by offering you outbound and inbound linking suggestions, making it <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/ways-link-assistant-can-save-you-time-on-internal-and-external-link-building/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">faster and easier to build internal links</a>. You can accept the suggestions individually or automatically add them all with one click.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest advantages of using Link Assistant is that it helps you easily find orphaned pages. These are pages that have no inbound or outbound links. These can lead to low traffic and poor rankings. With Link Assistant, you can quickly build internal links to these pages, thereby improving your SEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides internal linking and fixing broken links, AIOSEO also helps you easily <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/how-to-check-site-health/\">manage your website&#8217;s health</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"335\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-site-health-1.png\" alt=\"AIOSEO is a powerful tool that can help you maintain your site\'s health.\" class=\"wp-image-95630\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-site-health-1.png 700w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-site-health-1-300x144.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-site-health-1-600x287.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This feature helps ensure you get the best possible performance out of your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Update Your WordPress Site</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s strongly advised that you keep up to date with&nbsp;the latest version of WordPress and all plugins and themes&nbsp;installed on&nbsp;your site. This will help you avoid problems such as bugs and security vulnerabilities. To make your life easier, WordPress issues regular updates to increase its&nbsp;functionality, fix bugs and deal with security concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most plugin developers issue regular updates for their plugins. We recommend you install&nbsp;these updates as soon as they become available. This ensures your website is secure and performs at its optimum. It also helps get rid of bugs in the code and keeps you up to date with the latest features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always start by updating WordPress itself, then your themes, and then your plugins. You should do so in order to minimize the risk of any conflicts&nbsp;that&nbsp;may affect the <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/10-quick-easy-ways-to-speed-up-your-site/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">performance of your website</a>, particularly if your site is large and complex. In fact, apply your updates one at a time so you can quickly trace the source of any problem if one should occur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once done, you need to check that your website is functioning correctly after every update. Always double-check your site&#8217;s functionality and speed across all devices and browsers. Ensure that all links and navigational tools on your website work and direct users (regardless of device and browser) to the right places. This is especially important for SEO, as crawlers need to be able to access all content on your website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t want to go through the trouble of keeping WordPress, your themes, and plugins updated, you can use a plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/stops-core-theme-and-plugin-updates/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Easy Updates Manager</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Easy Updates Manager is a free plugin that allows you to manage automatic updates on your WordPress site. Once you&#8217;ve installed the plugin, go to <strong>Dashboard » Updates Options</strong> page to set up automatic updates for the software on your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"550\" height=\"432\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-automatic-updates.png\" alt=\"Plugins like Easy Updates Manager make WordPress website maintenance easy.\" class=\"wp-image-95661\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-automatic-updates.png 550w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-automatic-updates-300x236.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve set your auto-update preferences,  your themes, plugins, and WordPress will automatically update when a new version comes out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Maintain Your Database</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A WordPress database is a repository where all the necessary files pertaining to your website are stored. This includes information like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Usernames</li><li>Posts and pages</li><li>Comments</li><li>Theme and plugin configurations</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Your WordPress database is essential to the smooth running of your website. But for that to happen, it needs to be cleaned out every few months in order for it to keep running quickly and efficiently. The more content, plugins, themes and comments are added to your site, the more complex and heavy your database will be. This could eventually cause it to slow down; and over time, you may find that it takes way longer to retrieve data&nbsp;within your database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are various plugins that can help <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/how-to-clean-your-wordpress-database/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">keep your database clean</a>. A good one is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-sweep/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">WP-Sweep</a>, which keeps your information in an ordered format and reduces clutter. There are various other plugins available, like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-dbmanager/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">WP-DBManager</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aioseo.com/recommends/wp-optimize-premium/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">WP-Optimize</a>. Choose one that best suits your needs and is easy for you to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more on WordPress database management, <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/beginners-guide-to-wordpress-database-management-with-phpmyadmin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">check out this post</a> from our friends over at WPBeginner.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Use Google Analytics &amp; Search Console</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Regular usage of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aioseo.com/how-to-add-google-search-console-to-your-wordpress-website/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Search Console</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aioseo.com/how-to-set-up-google-analytics-on-a-wordpress-site/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Analytics</a>&nbsp;to view your&nbsp;site’s metrics&nbsp;will give you a clear picture of how&nbsp;different areas of your site are performing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use these tools to keep an eye on your site&#8217;s downtime, monitor which pages are loading slowly, and see which links may be broken. These are all common problems that can later become major issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you find Google Analytics difficult to navigate and understand, consider using the best Google Analytics plugin on the market — <a href=\"https://www.monsterinsights.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MonsterInsights</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-monsterinsights.png\" alt=\"MonsterInsights is the best Google Analytics plugin to help you with your WordPress website maintenance.\" class=\"wp-image-95699\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-monsterinsights.png 700w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-monsterinsights-300x183.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-monsterinsights-600x366.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>With MonsterInsights, you get all the goodness of Google Analytics but in a more user-friendly format. This enables you to get data on your website&#8217;s performance and other issues that warrant housekeeping.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>7. Clean Up Comment Spam</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve all been a victim of&nbsp;comment spam. We&#8217;re referring to those&nbsp;comments that contain live links intended to boost the SEO or sales of the users that post them. The good news is that you can prevent such spam by either using anti-spam techniques or turning off commenting altogether. To do that, you can go to your WordPress <strong>Setting</strong>s menu and select <strong>Discussion</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"613\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-comments-1.png\" alt=\"You can disable comments on your blog by going to the Discussions section under the Settings tab in your WordPress dashboard.\" class=\"wp-image-95708\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-comments-1.png 700w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-comments-1-300x263.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-comments-1-600x525.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This will open up a page giving you the option to enable or disable commenting on your blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"128\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-comments-2.png\" alt=\"Uncheck the &quot;Allow people to submit comments on new posts&quot; option to disable commenting.\" class=\"wp-image-95709\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-comments-2.png 700w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-comments-2-300x55.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-comments-2-600x110.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Doing so will disable all future comments on your blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can only disable comments on individual posts. You can do this by opening the post in editing mode. Next, head over to the right sidebar and scroll down to the <strong>Discussion</strong> setting:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"680\" height=\"726\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-disable-comments.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-95710\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-disable-comments.png 680w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-disable-comments-281x300.png 281w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wordpress-website-maintenance-disable-comments-600x641.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p> Make sure to uncheck the box to disable comments for that post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have already been hit by comment spam, you can counteract it by using plugins that delete all comments. Such plugins can also be useful if your site has a large number of posts and you would rather remove the comments all at once, rather than having to filter by post.&nbsp;The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/delete-all-comments-of-website/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Delete All Comments&nbsp;plugin</a> is a good reliable plugin for this purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image wp-image-2956\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img width=\"736\" height=\"416\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/comment-spam.png\" alt=\"Cleaning up comment spam is an essential aspect of WordPress website maintenance.\" class=\"wp-image-2956\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/comment-spam.png 736w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/comment-spam-600x339.png 600w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/comment-spam-300x170.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/comment-spam-442x250.png 442w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/comment-spam-100x57.png 100w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/comment-spam-150x85.png 150w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/comment-spam-200x113.png 200w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/comment-spam-450x254.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 736px) 100vw, 736px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, you also have the option of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-comments/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">disabling comments altogether with the Disable Comments&nbsp;plugin</a>. However, experiments in the past have proven&nbsp;that quality comments show search engines that your site has built an active community around it, and provides users with valuable information, which increases the ranking of your site. If you don&#8217;t want to miss out on all those tiny bits of precious SEO juice, you should invest some time to regularly approve and delete comments on a regular basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>8. Keep Your Site Health and Security Up-to-date</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It cannot be stated enough how important it is to take the security of your site seriously and to have the necessary precautions in place. And don’t worry, monitoring the security of your site does not have to be a long and drawn-out process, but can be done in a matter of minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can utilize platforms like Twitter, blogs, Facebook, and forums to keep abreast of the latest updates and security information of all your favorite developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An easy way to <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/how-to-check-site-health/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stay on top of your site&#8217;s health</a> is to use tools like <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/recommends/sucuri/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Sucuri</a>&nbsp;and search engines like Google:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">(1)</span> When you get to Sucuri, just type in the URL of your site and you&#8217;ll receive a free malware scan. You can then take a visual look at your site to spot anything suspicious in your texts or links.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">(2)</span> With Google, simply&nbsp;enter your URL into the Google search box&nbsp;in the following format: “site:yourdomain.com”. Hit enter to get a list of&nbsp;your indexed pages. Take a close look to ensure that all is looking as it should. This means ensuring all your pages are indexed (those that aren&#8217;t won&#8217;t show up in the results). Also, check for duplicate content. These processes, whilst not completely fail-proof, will definitely help you to better monitor your site’s health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If all of this seems a little arduous, remember that you also have the option of installing a security plugin like <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/recommends/ithemes-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">iThemes Security</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to set aside at least an hour every week to stay up-to-date using the above techniques.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Important Notes About&nbsp;Plugins</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few things to note when selecting, updating, and adding plugins to your site:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>When selecting plugins, always check the reputation of the source. Also, make sure it&#8217;s been tested to work with your version of WordPress, and whether support is available to you in the event that issues arise.</li><li>Keep your current plugins up to date, and delete any which are not in use, as this will maximize how you use your active plugins.</li><li>When adding a plugin, keep in mind that it may lower your page speed, so be sure to monitor any changes in page speed before and after you install one.</li><li>Check when it was last updated before installing it. This is a good indicator of whether it will work as should and if it is compatible with current versions of WordPress.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>WordPress Website Maintenance: An Essential Not to Be Neglected</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While all of this may seem overwhelming at first, maintenance is a crucial component to the smooth operation of your WordPress site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Proper site maintenance is something that even beginners can, and should try to prioritize. The best and most convenient way to stay on top of your&nbsp;site maintenance is to create a routine. A routine guarantees you enough time to perform these vital tasks, and the process consequently becomes easier in the long term. It will pay off in the long term by preventing slow load speeds and by enhancing the overall user experience. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, it will result in <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/seo-checklist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SEO wins</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why site maintenance must always be a part of your overall SEO strategy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To further boost your SEO results, consider using a <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/best-seo-plugins-for-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">powerful WordPress SEO plugin</a> like AIOSEO.

You can find Crawl Cleanup under Search Appearance that allows you to remove Query Args from your URLs.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"702\" height=\"181\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/crawl-cleanup-2.png\" alt=\"You\'ll find the Crawl Cleanup feature under the Search Appearance section of AIOSEO\'s settings.\" class=\"wp-image-93916\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/crawl-cleanup-2.png 702w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/crawl-cleanup-2-300x77.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/crawl-cleanup-2-600x155.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Query args, also known as URL parameters, are any part of a web address after a question mark (?), ampersand (&amp;), percentage sign (%), equals (=) or other attributes added to a URL. Here’s what a URL with a query arg would look like:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>https://example.com/10-keys-to-driving-organic-traffic/?page=2</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this example, “<strong>?page=2</strong>” is the query arg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Common uses of URL parameters (and simplified examples) include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Tracking session IDs: example.com/?sessionid=123</li><li>Filter product category pages: example.com/?product=small-blue-widget&nbsp;</li><li>Pagination: example.com/?page=2</li><li>Onsite search: example.com/?q=users-query&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with query args is that they result in multiple URLs for the same page. For example, an e-commerce site can have the following URLs pointing to the same page:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>https://example.com/store/products/&nbsp;</li><li>https://example.com/store/products/?category=hiking&amp;color=tan</li><li>https://example.com/store/products/?category=hiking&amp;type=womens&amp;color=brown</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This can hurt your SEO. For example, it can dilute search signals as search engines view the URLs as different pages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the biggest impact URL parameters have on SEO is that the multiple pages created can result in wasted crawl budget. This can lead to low-value pages being crawled and indexed, leaving high-value pages at a disadvantage. As a result, the low-value pages will rank higher than your important pages, costing you traffic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why we developed the Crawl Cleanup feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To use this feature, head over to your AIOSEO dashboard and select the <strong>Search Appearance</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced</strong>. Scroll down the page until you find the <strong>Crawl Cleanup</strong> section. Turn the toggle on to activate the feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once Crawl Cleanup is activated, all query args will be automatically stripped from your URLs, with the exception of any important query args that are used by WordPress Core (e.g. search terms for search results pages) or any query args you want to whitelist.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"702\" height=\"419\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/crawl-cleanup-1.png\" alt=\"The Crawl Cleanup feature enables you to select URLs you want tom cleanup and those you want to whitelist.\" class=\"wp-image-93918\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/crawl-cleanup-1.png 702w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/crawl-cleanup-1-300x179.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/crawl-cleanup-1-600x358.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>With Crawl Cleanup, you can remove unnecessary URL parameters. This will give you more flexibility and control over your URLs, thereby ensuring the right pages rank better.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Have More Control Over Your RSS Feeds</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another fantastic feature you’ll find under the Crawl Cleanup section is the ability to control your RSS feeds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/rss-feeds-1024x600.png\" alt=\"You can also select which RSS feeds to enable or disable on your site. \" class=\"wp-image-93920\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/rss-feeds-1024x600.png 1024w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/rss-feeds-300x176.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/rss-feeds-768x450.png 768w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/rss-feeds-1536x900.png 1536w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/rss-feeds-2048x1200.png 2048w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/rss-feeds-600x352.png 600w\" sizes=\"100vw\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, all RSS feeds are enabled in WordPress. However, once you enable Crawl Cleanup, you can decide which RSS feeds should be activated for your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will help you fine-tune your RSS marketing to help you target the right audience, resulting in an improvement in the quality of traffic that comes through your RSS feeds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-aioseo-theme-notice-box\" role=\"alert\">\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: These new features are for advanced users only. If you’re new to WordPress and don’t have experience with query args or large sitemaps, it’s best you don’t mess with these settings as they can have a significant impact on your website.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Import URLs from a CSV File to Add More Sitemap Pages</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sitemaps are an important element of SEO as they help search engines discover the essential pages on your site much faster. That’s why we make it easy for you to create optimized sitemaps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With AIOSEO 4.2.1, we’ve added a few improvements to our sitemap generator. One of the first changes is the improved user interface for adding additional sitemap pages. It’s cleaner and easier to use. We’ve also made some significant improvements to our multilingual sitemaps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the most significant improvement we’ve made, which we’re extremely excited about, is the ability to import URLs to your sitemap from a CSV file. Manually adding URLs to a sitemap can take forever for large sites with many pages that aren’t contained within WordPress. That’s why we’ve added bulk import support. This will enable you to create a list of pages in a CSV file that you can then upload to your sitemap. This will ensure that all your important pages, even those outside WordPress, can be included in your sitemap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find this feature by going to <strong>Sitemaps </strong>&gt; <strong>General Sitemaps</strong>. Then, scroll down the page, find the <strong>Additional Pages </strong>section, and enable it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"258\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sitemap-1.png\" alt=\"You can upload multiple pages to your sitemap by uploading a CSV file.\" class=\"wp-image-93921\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sitemap-1.png 700w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sitemap-1-300x111.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sitemap-1-600x221.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, you can add URLs individually by entering them in the URL field. To add multiple pages, you can click the <strong>Import from CSV</strong> button. This will open a modal that enables you to upload your CSV file.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img width=\"702\" height=\"395\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sitemap-download-from-csv.png\" alt=\"Clicking on the &quot;Import from CSV&quot; button will open a modal that enables you to upload your CSV file.\" class=\"wp-image-93922\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sitemap-download-from-csv.png 702w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sitemap-download-from-csv-300x169.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sitemap-download-from-csv-600x338.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the CSV file is uploaded, the selected URLs will be added to your sitemap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a few clicks, you can easily and quickly add multiple URLs to your sitemap, making it easier for search bots to find and crawl your site’s important pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want more details on the perfect URL structure for WordPress slugs?

As a result, it has also become a significant ranking factor in Google&#8217;s Page Experience algorithm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means if your site loads slowly, your chances of ranking drop. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>How fast?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-strategies/app-and-mobile/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">are some benchmarks from Google</a> on mobile load times to give you an idea:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"526\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/speed-up-your-wordpress-site-speed-chart.png\" alt=\"To know how to speed up your WordPress site, you must know the average industry benchmarks.\" class=\"wp-image-94343\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/speed-up-your-wordpress-site-speed-chart.png 700w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/speed-up-your-wordpress-site-speed-chart-300x225.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/speed-up-your-wordpress-site-speed-chart-600x451.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>3 Tools You Can Use to Test Your Site Speed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing your website&#8217;s loading speed isn&#8217;t as complicated as it sounds. It&#8217;s quite easy if you use the right tools. Three of our top recommendations include:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/free-website-speed-test-tool-for-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IsItWP Website Speed Test Tool</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/free-website-speed-test-tool-for-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IsItWP&#8217;s free website speed test tool&nbsp;</a>should be your first port of call if you&#8217;re looking for an easy-to-use website speed tester. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"516\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/speed-up-wordpress-site-isitwp.png\" alt=\"IsItWP has a powerful site speed tool to help you improve your WordPress site\'s speed.\" class=\"wp-image-94159\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/speed-up-wordpress-site-isitwp.png 700w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/speed-up-wordpress-site-isitwp-300x221.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/speed-up-wordpress-site-isitwp-600x442.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>This tool enables you to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Check your website&#8217;s performance</li><li>Run multiple tests</li><li>Pinpoint what&#8217;s slowing down your website</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the best features of the IsItWP website speed test tool is that it offers suggestions for improving your site&#8217;s load speed. It also provides server uptime monitoring and other helpful tools for website owners.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. <a href=\"https://pagespeed.web.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google Pagespeed Insights</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who want more granular control and advanced settings,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pagespeed.web.dev/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Google Pagespeed Insights</a>&nbsp;is your tool. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"305\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/speed-up-wordpress-site-google-pagespeed.png\" alt=\"Another tool you can use to check site speed is Google\'s Pagespeed Insights.\" class=\"wp-image-94177\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/speed-up-wordpress-site-google-pagespeed.png 700w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/speed-up-wordpress-site-google-pagespeed-300x131.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/speed-up-wordpress-site-google-pagespeed-600x261.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Created by Google, this is a free speed test tool that gives you website performance reports for mobile and desktop. It provides detailed reports and recommendations for each issue found. However, because it&#8217;s aimed at developers, some data can be difficult to understand, and the recommendations are daunting for novices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. <a href=\"https://www.pingdom.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Pingdom</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pingdom.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Pingdom</a>&nbsp;is one of the most popular website performance monitoring tools. However, unlike our first two, it&#8217;s not free.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/speed-up-wordpress-pingdom.png\" alt=\"If you want to speed up your WordPress site, Pingdom is one of the tools to have.\" class=\"wp-image-94160\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/speed-up-wordpress-pingdom.png 700w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/speed-up-wordpress-pingdom-300x148.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/speed-up-wordpress-pingdom-600x296.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest advantage of the tool is that it&#8217;s easy to use. It also allows you to set different criteria for your tests. For example, you can select different geographical locations to run a test, allowing you to see how fast your website loads for a particular geographical demographic. Once you&#8217;ve run your test, the results are presented on an easy-to-understand overview dashboard. You can also get a detailed report with all issues and how to fix them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With site speed being a critical SEO, UX, and CRO (conversion rate optimization) element, you can&#8217;t afford to neglect it.&nbsp;It&#8217;s an imporetant element of your overall WordPress performance optimization. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Optimize Your WordPress Website for Speed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Why is my WordPress site so slow?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you ask yourself this question often, you need to work on your site speed before it&#8217;s too late. Here are our top ten site speed optimization tips to get you started.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Choose a Good Hosting Service</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing a good hosting service can be tricky if you don&#8217;t have experience or advanced knowledge of the subject. Here are some of your options:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Shared Hosting</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As the name suggests, shared hosting is a hosting plan where you share server resources with many other users. Because of this, it&#8217;s the cheapest hosting option available (as low as $2.75/month) and is recommended for small blogs that aren&#8217;t resource-intensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Virtual Private Servers (VPS)</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>VPS hosting affords you more control and resources as your website is hosted in its own space, although still on a shared server. It offers the advantages of dedicated hosting without a hefty price tag. Of course, because the server is still shared, resources are also limited.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Dedicated Hosting</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Dedicated hosting is typically used by webmasters with experience in server technologies or by websites with enormously high traffic. So if you have a hugely popular site that needs dedicated servers and don&#8217;t understand the tech behind it, you may want to hire someone else who does.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Managed WordPress Hosting</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Managed WordPress hosting can be an excellent way to go if you have a large WordPress site with a lot of traffic. The servers are built for WordPress, so it comes with tools and features designed to make your WordPress site run optimally. You can also run WordPress on a VPS but managed WordPress hosting solutions are only intended for WordPress sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are, however, a few restrictions: certain WordPress features like plugins and themes may be disabled due to security concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Cloud Hosting</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Cloud hosting is a modern type of hosting that enables a website to be hosted on multiple servers. This results in faster and more reliable hosting performance and, ultimately, a faster website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most web hosting companies offer all the above types of hosting solutions. If you&#8217;re not sure which hosting provider to go with,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aioseo.com/best-wordpress-hosting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">check out this post</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Choose a Lightweight Theme</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Is your theme lightweight?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If not, you should consider switching to one. Unlike themes that offer many features – most of which you probably don&#8217;t use or need – and unnecessarily load too many scripts and styles, lightweight themes come with only the basic features you need. This makes them faster than themes that come with too many features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use various free plugins to optimize your site speed, but you won&#8217;t see results if your theme is not fast. If you&#8217;re looking for an optimized WordPress theme,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aioseo.com/best-wordpress-themes-for-seo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">check out our recommendations here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Reduce Image File Sizes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Images take up a lot of space in your wp-content folder and lower your site speed. It is always a good idea to follow&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aioseo.com/features/image-seo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">image SEO</a>&nbsp;best practices. You should also consider using an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aioseo.com/best-wordpress-image-compression-plugin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">image compression plugin</a>&nbsp;to ensure all your images are lightweight and load fast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Implement Lazy Loading</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Lazy loading is a technique that allows your page to render images as they are required instead of rendering them all at once. The former makes for faster loading, while the latter results in slower load speeds as the page can only fully load when all images have been loaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, lazy loading isn&#8217;t just confined to images. You can also apply it to other page elements like audio, video, comments, and text. One of the best plugins you can use to lazy load your site&#8217;s content is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/rocket-lazy-load/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Lazy Load by WP Rocket</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Use a Caching Plugin</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Caching is arguably the best way to speed up your site and improve performance. Let&#8217;s look at how it works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A cache is a place where data is temporarily stored. So when you visit a website for the first time, your browser caches active data to quicken the loading speed. Then, when you revisit the site, your browser will have a large portion of the site&#8217;s files stored within its cache. This results in faster loading times since your browser doesn&#8217;t need to collect many files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, caching plugins save an HTML copy of a website for a specific time. The plugin then serves these files from the cache (instead of getting the server to process them). Check out our article on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aioseo.com/best-wordpress-cache-plugin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">best caching plugins</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another way to speed up your site is to use a content delivery network (CDN). CDNs enable you to host images off your server to decrease image load times. They are also helpful in storage and potential migration of your site to a new host.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How does this help with site load speed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CDNs store requested files – cached static content – close to a visitor&#8217;s geographic location. So if your website is hosted in the United States, and a user accesses your site in Chicago, they may receive your site images from a data center in Illinois. Similarly, even with your site being hosted in the US, if a user in London accesses your site, they may receive your images from a data center within the UK. In this way, transfer times, hops and other processing parameters are decreased, resulting in a much faster site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Amazon Cloudfront</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aioseo.com/recommends/maxcdn/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">MaxCDN</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Cloudflare</a>&nbsp;are among the best CDN services you can use.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>7. Minify JS and CSS files</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your site has numerous types of code that control its looks, functionality, and behavior. The main types are HTML, CSS and JavaScript files. Because CSS and JavaScript are responsible for aesthetics and functionality, they are mainly written by humans to be read by humans. This results in the code including extra blank spaces, characters, comments, and formatting that servers do not need. As a result, more resources and time are needed to load the code and present it in a format humans can understand, i.e., a website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why you need to clean up your CSS and JavaScript files so servers can read them quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cssminifier.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">CSS Minifier</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://javascript-minifier.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">JavaScript Minifier</a>&nbsp;– both are free online tools – to remove the unnecessary spacing, lines, comments and formatting. Simply copy and paste the code you want to minify, and you&#8217;ll receive a minified version to paste back into your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are quite a few reliable plugins that do not require you to tamper with the settings. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-minify/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">WP Super Minify</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/autoptimize/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Autoptimize</a> are two great examples.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>8. Clean up Your WP Database</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your database stores a lot of data: from inactive plugins to revisions to spam and trashed comments. Getting rid of this unnecessary data can greatly reduce the size of your database and consequently speed up your site and improve performance. This is easy to do with a plugin.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-sweep/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">WP-Sweep</a>&nbsp;is by far the most popular and effective plugin for cleaning up a WordPress database. It is also quite straightforward to use. Once activated, go to&nbsp;<strong>Tools &gt; Sweep</strong>, and the plugin will begin analyzing your database. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"414\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/speed-up-wordpress-site-wpsweep.png\" alt=\"Another way to speed up your WordPress site is to use a plugin like WP-Sweep to clear out redundant files.\" class=\"wp-image-94165\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/speed-up-wordpress-site-wpsweep.png 700w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/speed-up-wordpress-site-wpsweep-300x177.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/speed-up-wordpress-site-wpsweep-600x355.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It will provide a report of different sections/components of your site that need to be cleaned. You can clean individual items or sweep everything up at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>9. Manage Your Redirects Properly</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As your website grows, you may change some content or delete some. You&#8217;ll need to redirect the old pages to the new ones when this happens. Manually managing these can be a painstaking task.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why we added a&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://aioseo.com/features/redirection-manager/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Redirection Manager</a>&nbsp;to our plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"698\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-checklist-redirects.png\" alt=\"Managing redirects properly is crucial to ensuring a fast website.\" class=\"wp-image-72677\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-checklist-redirects.png 698w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-checklist-redirects-300x111.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/seo-checklist-redirects-600x223.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Redirection Manager, you can automatically set up redirects, thereby helping you avoid broken links and 404 errors. You can also import redirects from other plugins and select HTTP statuses for redirects. It&#8217;s so powerful you can even use it to relocate an entire site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s get back to WordPress speed optimization. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Correctly implemented redirects will help ensure that your site architecture remains optimized. It also helps reduce unnecessary requests that result in longer TTFB (time to first byte). Managing them well will result in improved load times.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>10. Deactivate Hotlinking</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You may, unfortunately, be victim to content leeching or theft: other sites may be serving images from your site instead of uploading them on their own servers. In doing so, they steal your bandwidth, and you don&#8217;t benefit from any of the traffic they generate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is called hotlinking.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news is that you can prevent this by adding some code to your&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/htaccess/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">.htaccess file</a>.&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.javascriptkit.com/howto/htaccess10.shtml\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">This article from JavaScript Kit</a>&nbsp;takes you through the steps to get it done. You can also check out&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/beginners-guide-to-preventing-blog-content-scraping-in-wordpress/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">this article</a>&nbsp;from our friends at WPBeginner on how to prevent content theft.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Speed Up Your WordPress Site: It&#8217;s Crucial to Your Success</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speeding up your WordPress site can provide tremendous benefits.

You can easily add metadata and more advanced SEO features, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/how-to-create-a-sitemap-in-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">XML sitemaps</a></li><li><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/add-schema-markup-to-wordpress-without-a-plugin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">schema markup</a></li><li><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/how-to-edit-a-robots-txt-file-in-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">robots.txt&nbsp;files</a></li><li><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/announcing-improved-site-redirects-and-modified-date-for-posts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">URL redirects</a></li><li>And much more</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These, and other features, help improve your rankings and drive more traffic to your website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yoast SEO and All-in-One SEO are some of the <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/best-seo-plugins-for-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">best SEO plugins for WordPress</a>. That means you install them as plugins on your website, and they let you optimize your site for SEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/recommends/yoast-premium/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img width=\"730\" height=\"399\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/yoast-seo-homepage-1.png\" alt=\"Yoast SEO vs All in One SEO - Yoast SEO\" class=\"wp-image-30572\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/yoast-seo-homepage-1.png 730w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/yoast-seo-homepage-1-300x164.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/yoast-seo-homepage-1-600x328.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>AIOSEO offers a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">free version</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/pricing/\">4 paid versions</a>.

Let&#8217;s take a look at the differences in the configuration for both contenders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Installation Wizards Compared</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most important aspects to consider when looking for an SEO plugin is the ease of use, particularly the installation process. Let&#8217;s quickly look at how easy it is between our two contenders in the Yoast vs. All In One SEO showdown.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Installing Yoast SEO</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Yoast SEO has a 12-step installation wizard, and it gets pretty overwhelming. It throws the beginner into a complicated and cluttered dashboard with more technical information than necessary when just starting out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what you&#8217;ll see after <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">installing and activating</a> Yoast SEO. It&#8217;s an overview of the Yoast SEO Dashboard, and so far it looks okay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"730\" height=\"342\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/general-dashboard-yoast-seo.png\" alt=\"Yoast SEO dashboard general settings\" class=\"wp-image-24635\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/general-dashboard-yoast-seo.png 730w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/general-dashboard-yoast-seo-300x141.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/general-dashboard-yoast-seo-600x281.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the <strong>General settings</strong> tab, you can find a first-time SEO configuration wizard. It&#8217;s after clicking on this wizard that you get a knot in your stomach.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"730\" height=\"344\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/welcome-wizard-yoast-seo.png\" alt=\"Yoast SEO installation wizard\" class=\"wp-image-24636\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/welcome-wizard-yoast-seo.png 730w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/welcome-wizard-yoast-seo-300x141.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/welcome-wizard-yoast-seo-600x283.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While Yoast SEO&#8217;s configuration wizard has 12 steps and feels technical and complicated, AIOSEO&#8217;s setup wizard only has 4 steps that are easy to follow. It looks much cleaner and is straightforward and beginner-friendly. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Installing AIOSEO</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>AIOSEO has outdone itself in simplifying things and making it easier for users to set up their SEO settings. Let&#8217;s take a look at the setup wizard next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/docs/installing-all-in-one-seo-pro/\">installing and activating AIOSEO</a>, you’ll see the<strong> General Settings</strong> tab in the All in One SEO menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"730\" height=\"390\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-dashboard-general-settings.png\" alt=\"All in One SEO (AIOSEO) dashboard general settings\" class=\"wp-image-24632\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-dashboard-general-settings.png 730w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-dashboard-general-settings-300x160.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-dashboard-general-settings-600x321.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here you can see an overview of the AIOSEO Dashboard,<strong> </strong>and you can launch the Setup Wizard with a single click. There’s also a video to watch that helps users understand the setup process before they start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <strong>General Settings</strong>, you have the option to switch between three more tabs. The <strong><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/features/webmaster-tools/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Webmaster Tools</a></strong> tab is especially useful since it allows you to submit your site to search engines such as Google, Bing, Yandex, etc. You can also use it for instant indexing of your content on platforms that support the <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/what-is-indexnow-for-seo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IndexNow protocol</a>. This is a protocol Yoast has said they <a href=\"https://www.seroundtable.com/yoast-indexnow-proof-33013.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">aren&#8217;t interested in adopting</a>, giving SEO plugin users like AIOSEO an edge.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"730\" height=\"433\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-setup-wizard.png\" alt=\"All in One SEO (AIOSEO) setup wizard\" class=\"wp-image-24633\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-setup-wizard.png 730w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-setup-wizard-300x178.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-setup-wizard-600x356.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, you&#8217;re able to categorize your site, as well as set up the Home Page Title and Meta Description. AIOSEO makes this easy and beginner-friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast to Yoast SEO, All in One SEO has lots of pre-installed tags with different variables that you can use for your homepage&#8217;s title and description. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"730\" height=\"662\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/setup-home-page-title-and-description-in-aioseo-1.png\" alt=\"All in One SEO\'s home page title and meta description setting\" class=\"wp-image-41074\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/setup-home-page-title-and-description-in-aioseo-1.png 730w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/setup-home-page-title-and-description-in-aioseo-1-300x272.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/setup-home-page-title-and-description-in-aioseo-1-600x544.png 600w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/setup-home-page-title-and-description-in-aioseo-1-66x60.png 66w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/setup-home-page-title-and-description-in-aioseo-1-99x90.png 99w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you’d choose the Site Title smart tag, the name of your site will be added to the SEO title. It lets you choose between 22 variables, such as Author Last Name, Author First Name, Post Day, Post Date, and much more.&nbsp;These are options that Yoast SEO doesn&#8217;t have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to forget, the + Current Year tag, which is an incredible feature to easily add the year to your SEO title.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/current-year-title-tag-in-all-in-one-seo.png\"><img width=\"730\" height=\"144\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/current-year-title-tag-in-all-in-one-seo.png\" alt=\"The current year title tag in All in One SEO\" class=\"wp-image-25328\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/current-year-title-tag-in-all-in-one-seo.png 730w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/current-year-title-tag-in-all-in-one-seo-300x59.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/current-year-title-tag-in-all-in-one-seo-600x118.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, AIOSEO has many more great SEO features, which help make the optimization process easier. In this regard, AIOSEO is leaps ahead of Yoast SEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, to something even more exciting!

With that said, let’s move on to looking at how both WordPress SEO plugins handle on-page optimization.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"on-page-optimization\">On-page Optimization </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/infographics-template-seo-optimization.jpg\"><img width=\"730\" height=\"365\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/infographics-template-seo-optimization.jpg\" alt=\"Search engine optimization infographic by freepik\" class=\"wp-image-25551\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/infographics-template-seo-optimization.jpg 730w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/infographics-template-seo-optimization-300x150.jpg 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/infographics-template-seo-optimization-600x300.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Image Source: <a href=\"https://www.freepik.com/premium-vector/infographics-template-seo-optimization_3698079.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">freepik</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On-page optimization is an ongoing process, and each new post or page you add to your site will have its own SEO score.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means you’ll be using your SEO plugin to optimize your content for search engines as you add it. For more details, check out our checklist on <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/blog-post-seo-checklist/\">how to optimize your blog posts for SEO</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>SEO Meta Box  </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Both plugins come with an SEO meta box to edit the SEO settings on a post-by-post basis. They automatically use your post or page’s title as SEO Title and excerpt as Meta Description, but you can also enter your own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we showed you earlier, AIOSEO makes this super easy with lots of different variables you can use to optimize your metadata, while Yoast SEO only has variables for the title, page, separator, and site title.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SEO meta box in Yoast SEO also looks a bit cluttered and feels outdated since it starts with the Focus keyphrase option that&#8217;s not really important for SEO anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img width=\"730\" height=\"662\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/seo-meta-box-yoast-seo.png\" alt=\"Yoast SEO\'s meta box\" class=\"wp-image-40421\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/seo-meta-box-yoast-seo.png 730w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/seo-meta-box-yoast-seo-300x272.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/seo-meta-box-yoast-seo-600x544.png 600w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/seo-meta-box-yoast-seo-66x60.png 66w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/seo-meta-box-yoast-seo-99x90.png 99w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast to Yoast SEO, All in One SEO&#8217;s meta box begins with a Snippet Preview<strong> </strong>of your post or page’s SEO. This is very helpful so that users can see how their Post Title and Meta Description will look in search results.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"730\" height=\"565\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-settings-general-post-title-and-description.png\" alt=\"AIOSEO general settings for post title and meta description \" class=\"wp-image-24637\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-settings-general-post-title-and-description.png 730w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-settings-general-post-title-and-description-300x232.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-settings-general-post-title-and-description-600x464.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can write the Post Title and Meta Description manually or use the tags with different variables.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this reason, AIOSEO&#8217;s meta box is more logical. It starts with the most important element you should be optimizing and ends with less important factors like the Focus Keyphrase. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you still want to check your Focus Keyphrase, AIOSEO even gives you a score of how well your keyphrase is optimized and recommendations on how to improve it. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"730\" height=\"356\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-settings-focus-keyphrase-analysis.png\" alt=\"Focus keyphrase score and analysis in All in One SEO (AIOSEO) \" class=\"wp-image-24638\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-settings-focus-keyphrase-analysis.png 730w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-settings-focus-keyphrase-analysis-300x146.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-settings-focus-keyphrase-analysis-600x293.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While Yoast SEO briefly includes this feature in the content analysis tool, it doesn&#8217;t analyze it separately.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>On-Page Content Analysis </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The content analysis feature for both SEO plugins analyzes your content against SEO best practices. For instance, it checks the keyword density, readability, and the number of internal and external links. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also checks if you&#8217;ve used your focus keyphrase in the title, meta description, and first paragraph of your content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, Yoast SEO was ahead of AIOSEO in regards to this feature. But AIOSEO later caught up with flying colors. We&#8217;ll show you exactly why next.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"706\" height=\"488\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/yoast-seo-content-analysis.png\" alt=\"SEO analysis in Yoast SEO\" class=\"wp-image-37577\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/yoast-seo-content-analysis.png 706w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/yoast-seo-content-analysis-300x207.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/yoast-seo-content-analysis-600x415.png 600w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/yoast-seo-content-analysis-87x60.png 87w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/yoast-seo-content-analysis-130x90.png 130w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 706px) 100vw, 706px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While Yoast SEO provides a fairly detailed analysis of the page content and recommendations on how to improve your SEO, AIOSEO also does this, and more! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, AIOSEO even analyzes your Title and gives you immediate results on what you need to improve.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Yoast-vs-all-in-one-seo-title-analysis.png\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"253\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Yoast-vs-all-in-one-seo-title-analysis.png\" alt=\"The Title analysis in AIOSEO helps you craft titles that rank well in search and attract clicks from users.\" class=\"wp-image-93594\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Yoast-vs-all-in-one-seo-title-analysis.png 700w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Yoast-vs-all-in-one-seo-title-analysis-300x108.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Yoast-vs-all-in-one-seo-title-analysis-600x217.png 600w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Yoast-vs-all-in-one-seo-title-analysis-166x60.png 166w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Yoast-vs-all-in-one-seo-title-analysis-249x90.png 249w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It analyzes a few different factors in your title, including title length, if it includes a number, and if it&#8217;s using any <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/blog-post-seo-checklist/#write-a-captivating-blog-post-title\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">power and sentiment words</a>. By optimizing your title, you can rest assured that it has all the elements that entice your visitors to click on it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the <strong>Basic SEO</strong> tab, you&#8217;ll find a clear overview of the page analysis tool. As well as your overall post or page’s SEO score in the top right corner of your page. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"730\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-page-analysis-basic-seo.png\" alt=\"Basic SEO page analysis in All in One SEO (AIOSEO) \" class=\"wp-image-24639\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-page-analysis-basic-seo.png 730w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-page-analysis-basic-seo-300x152.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-page-analysis-basic-seo-600x303.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Readability Analysis</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most important factors for SEO is readability. Blog posts that are easier to read often rank higher than posts that are difficult to read. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to the Readability feature, both contenders are pretty similar.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"706\" height=\"713\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/yoast-readability-analysis.png\" alt=\"Yoast SEO readability analysis\" class=\"wp-image-37567\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/yoast-readability-analysis.png 706w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/yoast-readability-analysis-297x300.png 297w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/yoast-readability-analysis-150x150.png 150w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/yoast-readability-analysis-600x606.png 600w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/yoast-readability-analysis-100x100.png 100w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/yoast-readability-analysis-59x60.png 59w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/yoast-readability-analysis-89x90.png 89w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 706px) 100vw, 706px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They both offer a detailed Readability analysis and give suggestions on what to improve. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"730\" height=\"551\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/aioseo-page-analysis-readability.png\" alt=\"Readability analysis in All in One SEO (AIOSEO)\" class=\"wp-image-37353\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/aioseo-page-analysis-readability.png 730w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/aioseo-page-analysis-readability-300x226.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/aioseo-page-analysis-readability-600x453.png 600w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/aioseo-page-analysis-readability-79x60.png 79w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/aioseo-page-analysis-readability-119x90.png 119w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So when it comes to on-page content analysis tools, AIOSEO is the best around. It&#8217;s much easier to navigate and will help you crush it in search engines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, we’ll move on to an important SEO factor, which is XML sitemaps. Let’s see if there are any major differences between our contenders with reference to this feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"xml-sitemaps\">XML Sitemaps</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you can rank on Google, your content needs to be indexed. If the search engines aren’t indexing your site, no amount of SEO can save you.&nbsp;That&#8217;s why XML sitemaps are important for SEO. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Yoast SEO and AIOSEO offer <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/docs/how-to-create-an-xml-sitemap/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">built-in XML sitemap functionality</a> that’s enabled by default. But in contrast to Yoast SEO, AIOSEO also offers an <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/docs/how-to-create-an-rss-sitemap/?utm_source=WordPress&amp;utm_campaign=proplugin&amp;utm_medium=documentation&amp;utm_content=rssSitemaps\">RSS sitemap</a>, which is automatically submitted to search engines.

Anyway, social media integration is one of these features that we&#8217;ll look at for both plugins next.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Social Media Integration</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimizing your social media is important because it can strengthen your brand. You&#8217;ll gain more visibility and can generate more leads for your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AIOSEO lets you add up to 11 social media profiles, whereas with Yoast SEO, you can only add 8 profiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let&#8217;s show you how to add your social media profiles for both plugins, starting with AIOSEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this in AIOSEO, you simply navigate to Social Networks<strong> </strong>in the All in One SEO menu.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"730\" height=\"496\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/social-networks-menu-item-in-aioseo-1.png\" alt=\"Social networks in All in One SEO (AIOSEO)\" class=\"wp-image-24648\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/social-networks-menu-item-in-aioseo-1.png 730w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/social-networks-menu-item-in-aioseo-1-300x204.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/social-networks-menu-item-in-aioseo-1-600x408.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This will open a window, where you can add all your social profiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"730\" height=\"587\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-social-networks-social-profiles.png\" alt=\"Social profiles in All in One SEO (AIOSEO)\" class=\"wp-image-24649\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-social-networks-social-profiles.png 730w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-social-networks-social-profiles-300x241.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-social-networks-social-profiles-600x482.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For Yoast SEO, you’ll find the social profiles in <strong>Social </strong>and the <strong>Accounts</strong> tab.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"730\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/yoast-seo-social-profiles.png\" alt=\"Social accounts in Yoast SEO\" class=\"wp-image-24650\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/yoast-seo-social-profiles.png 730w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/yoast-seo-social-profiles-300x247.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/yoast-seo-social-profiles-600x493.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, Yoast SEO has 3 fewer social media accounts to submit your links to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And looking more closely, there are also differences in how you set your Facebook thumbnail and Twitter Cards for both plugins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With AIOSEO, you can set your Facebook thumbnail and Twitter Cards from the <strong>Social Networks</strong> tab, but you can also do this from your individual posts or pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you’re editing your blog post or page, you can go directly to the <strong>Social </strong>tab in the AIOSEO Settings, and edit your Facebook thumbnail or Twitter Cards for each individual post and page. If you want to learn how to do this, you can check out our guides on <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/add-twitter-cards-in-wordpress/\">how to add Twitter Cards in WordPress</a> and <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/how-to-fix-wrong-facebook-thumbnail-in-wordpress\">how to fix the wrong Facebook thumbnail</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"726\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/set-facebook-thumbnail-on-individual-posts-and-pages.png\" alt=\"Set Facebook thumbnail in All in One SEO (AIOSEO)\" class=\"wp-image-24266\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/set-facebook-thumbnail-on-individual-posts-and-pages.png 726w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/set-facebook-thumbnail-on-individual-posts-and-pages-300x149.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/set-facebook-thumbnail-on-individual-posts-and-pages-600x298.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It gives you a beautiful preview of how your content will look when it’s shared on Facebook or Twitter. You can also edit your title and description, as well as upload a featured image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Yoast SEO, the settings look more basic and the preview snippet doesn&#8217;t look as nice as in AIOSEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/yoast-seo-social-facebook-settings.png\"><img width=\"730\" height=\"467\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/yoast-seo-social-facebook-settings.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-24651\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/yoast-seo-social-facebook-settings.png 730w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/yoast-seo-social-facebook-settings-300x192.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/yoast-seo-social-facebook-settings-600x384.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To summarize, both plugins offer similar social media integration. But AIOSEO gives you the option to tell Google about 3 more of your social media profiles. It also comes with a better social network window that’s easier to navigate and simply looks better.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But are those all the SEO tools and features offered by both plugins? Of course not!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s also take a look at more advanced SEO tools for both contenders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Advanced SEO Tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Advanced SEO tools help you further optimize your site for search engines without having to install any additional plugins. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To start with, both SEO plugins offer key features like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Built-in robots.txt and .htaccess editor</li><li>XML Sitemaps</li><li>Import and export SEO data</li><li>Breadcrumb navigation</li><li>Canonical links</li><li>Redirection manager</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from these tools, AIOSEO also offers <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/features/access-controls/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">User Access Control</a>, which is an awesome tool. It allows you to manage access to important SEO features without handing over control of your website. Please check out the video if you want a sneak peek at how it works. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"All in One SEO&#039;s SEO Manager Role\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NjTyy7qCc44?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can probably understand why this is important when running a big business with many employees that all have different roles within the company. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, AIOSEO also comes with advanced <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/features/woocommerce-seo/\">eCommerce SEO</a> support for WooCommerce to optimize product pages, product categories, and more. As well as <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/features/local-seo/\">Local SEO</a> to help you rank on Google maps, and easily submit your business name, logo, address, and phone number to search engines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other notable tools AIOSEO users enjoy include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/features/internal-link-assistant/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Link Assistant</a></li><li><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/features/indexnow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">IndexNow</a></li><li>Limit the modified date of updated posts</li><li>Standalone headline analyzer</li><li><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/features/redirection-manager/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Redirection Manager</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For Yoast SEO, you have to buy these features as extra functionalities, meaning separate plugins. Or you&#8217;d have to buy the full Yoast SEO package including all SEO plugins, which is quite expensive. That&#8217;s why, if you&#8217;re looking for a Yoast alternative that comes with advanced features, AIOSEO is it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"paid-plans-and-pricing\">Paid Plans and Pricing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As your site grows, you’ll want to improve your SEO so that you can climb the rankings on Google.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the free versions come with minimal features, premium versions give you more control over your website&#8217;s SEO. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that said, deciding on a plan can be confusing. We’ll try to break down the important facts about these 2 plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Free Plans for 1 Single Website</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’re just starting out, you’ll want to start with the free version of your SEO plugin to try it out. Both AIOSEO and Yoast SEO offer a free version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AIOSEO&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">free version </a>has over 3+ million active installations and 1142 five-star ratings. In other words, over 2 million smart website owners use AIOSEO to properly set up WordPress SEO, so their websites can rank higher in search engines. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Yoast-vs-all-in-one-seo-1-1024x960.png\" alt=\"AIOSEO is one of the best SEO plugins in WordPress\'s repository of plugins.\" class=\"wp-image-93598\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Yoast-vs-all-in-one-seo-1-1024x960.png 1024w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Yoast-vs-all-in-one-seo-1-300x281.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Yoast-vs-all-in-one-seo-1-768x720.png 768w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Yoast-vs-all-in-one-seo-1-600x562.png 600w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Yoast-vs-all-in-one-seo-1-64x60.png 64w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Yoast-vs-all-in-one-seo-1-96x90.png 96w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Yoast-vs-all-in-one-seo-1.png 1242w\" sizes=\"100vw\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Paid Plans for Several Websites</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you feel you want to use more advanced SEO tools on a single site, you can start with AIOSEO&#8217;s Basic plan for as little as $49 per year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you want to take your SEO efforts to the next level, you should consider buying the <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/pricing/\">Plus</a> version for $99.50 per year (up to 3 sites) or the <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/pricing/\">Pro</a> version for $199.50 per year (up to 10 sites). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/pricing/\"><img width=\"730\" height=\"481\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-pricing.png\" alt=\"Yoast SEO vs All in One SEO - pricing for AIOSEO\" class=\"wp-image-24663\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-pricing.png 730w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-pricing-300x198.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-pricing-600x395.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Better yet, the <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/pricing/\">Elite</a> version is for business owners with up to 100 sites. And the Pro and Elite versions also offer 1 year of professional priority support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yoast SEO is priced higher than AIOSEO for all its versions. Pricing for a <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/recommends/yoast-premium/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">single site license</a> starts at $99 per year and moves up to $169 per year (for up to 5 sites). And yet, these plans don&#8217;t even include many of the advanced SEO tools that All in One SEO offers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, you have to buy the different SEO features separately, which gets quite expensive since most are $79 per year (for each addon).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you want to include all features, the price increases to $229 per year (for the single site license. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did we say that you can get up to 100 websites (all features included) for only $299.50 with AIOSEO’s <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/pricing/\">Elite</a> version?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That pretty much summarizes which of the SEO plugins should be your one and only choice!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More importantly, to give you that extra sense of security, AIOSEO also offers a 14-day no-risk money-back guarantee. So if your plan isn’t a good fit, you can get your money back. You don’t even need to give a reason for the refund.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-no-risk-money-back-guarantee.png\"><img width=\"730\" height=\"254\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-no-risk-money-back-guarantee.png\" alt=\"100% No-Risk Money Back Guarantee for All in One SEO\" class=\"wp-image-25603\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-no-risk-money-back-guarantee.png 730w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-no-risk-money-back-guarantee-300x104.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-no-risk-money-back-guarantee-600x209.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, let’s take a look at the support you’ll get from the Premium and Pro versions of both SEO plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"yoast-seo-vs-all-in-one-seo-support\">Yoast SEO vs All in One SEO Support</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though both plugins are fairly easy to use and come with extensive free documentation and video tutorials, your free support options are limited. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Support for Free Versions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Both SEO plugins offer support for free users through <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/all-in-one-seo-pack/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">WordPress forums</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of writing this Yoast SEO vs All in One SEO post:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>AIOSEO has resolved 101 out of 122 support threads (83%)</li><li>Yoast SEO has resolved 609 out of 666 support threads (91%)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The response time is 1-3 working days for both plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Support for Paid Versions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you pay for either of these plugins, you can access ticket support as well. Within 1 day, you can expect a response to the support tickets from both Yoast SEO and AIOSEO support teams. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Best of all, AIOSEO gives you extensive documentation on how to configure all different SEO tools in its <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/docs/\">Documentation</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/docs/\"><img width=\"730\" height=\"424\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-documentation-and-tutorials.png\" alt=\"AIOSEO documentation and tutorials\" class=\"wp-image-25593\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-documentation-and-tutorials.png 730w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-documentation-and-tutorials-300x174.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/aioseo-documentation-and-tutorials-600x348.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don&#8217;t find what you&#8217;re looking for, you can also search for it with the search tool. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having all of these different support options makes it easy to get help whenever you need it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"yoast-seo-vs-all-in-one-seo-which-is-best\">Yoast SEO vs All in One SEO: Which Is Best?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img width=\"730\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-seo-plugins-for-wordpress.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-24673\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-seo-plugins-for-wordpress.png 730w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-seo-plugins-for-wordpress-300x290.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/best-seo-plugins-for-wordpress-600x580.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Image Source: <a href=\"https://www.lipperhey.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Lipperhey</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in One SEO and Yoast SEO are both great plugins. They are developed with the same goal – to make SEO tasks easy and straightforward for WordPress websites. And they are both doing that exceptionally well!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, as you&#8217;ve probably understood by now, AIOSEO has passed Yoast SEO with flying colors and is absolutely the best WordPress SEO plugin on the market. For instance, it offers more advanced SEO tools like <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/features/access-controls/\">user access control</a>, the option to <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/how-to-create-a-sitemap-in-wordpress/\">customize your sitemaps</a>, and much more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not to forget, the awesome on-page <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/features/seo-audit-checklist/\">SEO audit checklist tool</a>. As well as the option to <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/how-to-do-an-seo-competitor-analysis/\">analyze your competitors’ SEO</a>. These are great tools to get ahead of your competitors and gain an edge. And totally unique for All in One SEO!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Undeniably, AIOSEO also comes in neater, tidier, and altogether more user-friendly packaging. When it comes to setting up SEO for individual posts and pages, AIOSEO makes this easier too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Best of all, AIOSEO is a lot cheaper than Yoast SEO. Besides, it even allows you to add up to 100 websites in contrast to only 20 sites for Yoast SEO.&nbsp;Now that&#8217;s value for money!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And did we tell you that if you&#8217;re running a news site, you can automatically <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/submit-your-site-to-google-news/\">submit it to Google News</a>? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mentioning all the features you get with AIOSEO would take up a lot of space and time, so we won&#8217;t do it here.

One reason users love it is the simplicity and ease of use it affords.

That&#8217;s why you must master it or outsource it to those who have.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you plan on handling your content creation, SEO copywriting should be an essential part of your SEO strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>SEO Copywriting Tips: 10 To Help You Turn Pro Copywriter</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to master SEO copywriting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re a blogger, small business owner, or running an ecommerce store, SEO copywriting is essential to help you drive targeted traffic to your site. In addition, it helps improve your search engine rankings and encourages users to act on your content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s quickly dive into our ten tips to help you get there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. <strong>Write for People First</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the first SEO copywriting best practices you must never forget is to write for people first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, the main aim of SEO is to craft <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/seo-best-practices/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">content that ranks well</a> on search engine results pages (SERPs). However, ranking high without converting won&#8217;t do your business any good. After all, you need people to read your content and act on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why people should always come first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To create user-centric content:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Make it easy to read</strong>: Keep sentences and paragraphs short.</li><li><strong>Get to the point</strong>: People don&#8217;t have time to sift through a gazillion words to find the answer to their search query. Get to the point quickly or risk high bounce rates.</li><li><strong>Create in-depth content</strong>: Give users as much information as possible, so they get the full answer to their questions. This will help establish you as an authority in your niche.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating content for users will help you grow an engaged audience. It will also increase the chances of your content being shared, resulting in more traffic to your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. <strong>Nail Your Keyword Research</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another important element of SEO copywriting you need to master is keyword research. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"222\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/organic-traffic-keyword-research-1.png\" alt=\"Keyword research plays a huge role in SEO copywriting.\" class=\"wp-image-90714\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/organic-traffic-keyword-research-1.png 700w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/organic-traffic-keyword-research-1-300x95.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/organic-traffic-keyword-research-1-600x190.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Keyword research is the practice of identifying phrases and words (search terms) your target audience uses when looking for something online. Because people usually type in multi-word phrases, <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/how-to-find-long-tail-keywords-and-increase-organic-traffic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">long-tail keywords</a> should be your target.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can research the right keywords for your content by using keyword tools like <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/recommends/semrush/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Semrush</a>, <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/recommends/ahrefs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">Ahrefs</a>, <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/recommends/mangools/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener nofollow\">KWFinder by Mangools</a>, etc. You can also use Google&#8217;s People Also Ask section and the autosuggest feature to find related keywords users input the most. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve found your target keywords, the next step is to use them strategically. For example, if you&#8217;re writing a blog post, you can use your keywords in the:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Headline and SEO title</li><li>Header tags</li><li>Content</li><li>Metadata</li><li>Image alt tags</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The proper use of keywords will help your <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/seo-checklist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">content rank higher in search</a> for queries that contain that particular keyword. Also, make sure to use your keywords naturally and avoid keyword stuffing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Targeting specific keywords in your SEO copy will help you drive the right kind of traffic to your website. As a result, you&#8217;ll enjoy better conversions and a boost in revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. <strong>Master Search Intent</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For your content to be impactful and help you drive business goals, it must provide value to readers. To do this, you need to know why searchers are using the particular keywords they input into the search bar. Search intent is also a factor search algorithms consider when ranking content, making it a critical element of any <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/seo-hacks-to-grow-your-traffic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SEO strategy.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it may sound complicated, figuring search intent is quite easy. Two of the best ways to do it include: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Use tools</strong>: keyword research tools like Semrush have a search intent feature that helps highlight the most common user intent behind a keyword.</li><li><strong>Study SERPs</strong>: Take a close look at SERPs and see the type of content that ranks well.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing search intent is critical if you&#8217;re to create content that users will find valuable and can relate to. This will result in a boost in SEO metrics like clickthrough rate, dwell time, page views, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. <strong>SEO Copywriting Focuses on Quality, Not Quantity</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One mistake many marketers make when writing content is to focus on quantity at the expense of the quality of content produced. While churning out many articles may increase the chances of your website ranking, it certainly won&#8217;t improve conversions. Great content takes time and effort. While you may not produce much content, the quality will pay off in better conversion rates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, SEO copywriting should result in both ranking and conversions. If you get one without the other, you&#8217;re still missing out on many opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to create content that ranks and converts is to focus more on quality than quantity. And the best way to do that is to <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/what-is-google-eat/\">follow Google&#8217;s E-A-T standards</a>. Doing so will help ensure that your readers will keep coming back for more. It also increases the chances of your content being shared. Both have a positive impact on your rankings and conversions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest advantage of creating quality, in-depth content is that people will remember it and refer to it often. They&#8217;ll also share it on <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/best-social-media-plugins-for-wordpress-compared/\">social media</a> and other platforms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>High-quality content also helps you differentiate yourself from the competition. It also goes a long way in helping you prove your expertise on the subject you&#8217;re writing about.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. <strong>Craft Compelling Headlines and Title Tags</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your headlines play a huge role in how search engines rank your content. They also help users determine whether your content will meet their intent or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why you must <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/best-wordpress-headline-analyzer-tool/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">craft compelling SEO-friendly headlines</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"283\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/best-headline-analyzer-tool-AIOSEO.png\" alt=\"Headlines play an important role in SEO copywriting. That\'s why you muse optimize yours with a headline analyzer.\" class=\"wp-image-65771\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/best-headline-analyzer-tool-AIOSEO.png 283w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/best-headline-analyzer-tool-AIOSEO-142x300.png 142w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 283px) 100vw, 283px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Include your keyword, preferably as close to the beginning as possible</li><li>Craft a headline that meets search intent</li><li>Use action words to spur readers into action</li><li>Keep it simple and avoid being clever</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Your headline is your elevator pitch. It&#8217;s your first opportunity to get users to click on your URL on SERPs. It&#8217;s also a key element to successful on-page SEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should also <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/seo-title-tags/\">craft optimized title tags</a>, apart from crafting a compelling headline. Title tags are an HTML element used to specify the title of a webpage and are shown on SERPs as your content&#8217;s headline. Written well, they can help you rank well, and users will want to click. AIOSEO can help you create optimized title tags. To do so, scroll down to the bottom of the page you&#8217;re editing to find AIOSEO&#8217;s settings. Under the General tab, you&#8217;ll find a field to input your title tag.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimize it by including your keyword and keeping it within the recommended character limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. <strong>Create Your Header Tags with Users and Search Engines in Mind</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Header tags are an important part of your copy. They are an excellent way of breaking up your content. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"738\" height=\"478\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/header-tags-user-intent.png\" alt=\"Mastering SEO copywriting involves crafting \" class=\"wp-image-85304\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/header-tags-user-intent.png 738w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/header-tags-user-intent-300x194.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/header-tags-user-intent-600x389.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 738px) 100vw, 738px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>They also play an essential role in effective SEO copywriting. That&#8217;s because you can strategically use them to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Use your keywords strategically</li><li>Structure your content and improve UX</li><li>Help you rank for featured snippets</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://aioseo.com/header-tags/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Check out this guide</a> to better understand what header tags are and how to use them effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>7. <strong>Don&#8217;t Neglect Your Metadata&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An essential aspect of SEO you shouldn&#8217;t neglect when crafting content is your metadata. Metadata refers to HTML tags added to a web page to help search engines and users better understand what your page is about. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some common examples include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>SEO titles</li><li>Meta descriptions</li><li>Alt tags</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Optimizing your metadata doesn&#8217;t have a direct impact on your rankings. However, if optimized well, it can help increase your CTR. This, in turn, signals to search engines that your content is valuable, resulting in your content ranking better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure to give your metadata some careful thought. Crafting it well can make the difference between searchers clicking your link or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>8. <strong>Internal Linking is an Important Element of SEO Copywriting</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Internal linking is one of the most overlooked elements of SEO copywriting. With Google saying that links are among the <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/now-know-googles-top-three-search-ranking-factors-245882\">top three criteria used for ranking content</a>, every content creator must have an internal linking strategy they use to ensure content:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Ranks well</li><li>Offers users a better on-page experience</li><li>Provides more resources for those who want to delve deeper into a topic</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, if you&#8217;re an AIOSEO Pro user, you can do this on autopilot — thanks to Link Assistant. <a href=\"https://aioseo.com/ways-link-assistant-can-save-you-time-on-internal-and-external-link-building/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Link Assistant</a> is a powerful tool that searches for related posts and suggests anchor text you can use. If you don&#8217;t like the suggested link or anchor text, you can always reject the link or edit the anchor text.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"329\" src=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/internal-linking-with-link-assistant-getting-started.png\" alt=\"Link Assistant is a powerful tool for building internal links.\" class=\"wp-image-79016\" srcset=\"https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/internal-linking-with-link-assistant-getting-started.png 700w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/internal-linking-with-link-assistant-getting-started-300x141.png 300w, https://aioseo.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/internal-linking-with-link-assistant-getting-started-600x282.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Link building is a powerful on-page SEO best practice you should consider as you master SEO copywriting. Link Assistant will help ensure your internal links are strategically placed. It also enables you to audit your outbound links, making it easy to remove irrelevant ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>9. <strong>Consider User Experience</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When crafting content, take users into account by envisioning the experience they&#8217;ll have as they interact with your content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You must make it easy for them to find the answers they&#8217;re looking for easily. Also, ensure they don&#8217;t struggle to get the flow of your content. To achieve this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Keep your content simple</strong>: Avoid jargon and complicated words. Aim for good readability scores, which means your content is easy to read and understand.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Write for clarity, not cleverness</strong>: From word choice to sentence structure to the examples you use, aim to convey your message as clearly as possible.</li><li><strong>Format your content well</strong>: Use images, header tags, and white space to format your content to make it easy to read and digest.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re an AIOSEO user, crafting content that provides a positive user experience is easier as the plugin helps you with the above aspects. The <strong>Page Analysis </strong>report shows you where you need to simplify your language, when you have large walls of text, and a few other tips to make your content easier to read.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Considering user experience is a great way to reduce bounce rates while improving other important metrics such as dwell time, page views, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>10. <strong>Create Content With a Purpose</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A good content strategy is focused on achieving a particular result. That&#8217;s why every piece of content you create should serve a purpose — it must have a goal. Some of the goals you can set for your content include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Brand awareness</li><li>Lead generation</li><li>Product education</li><li>Build trust</li><li>Attract backlinks</li><li>Driving sales</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Your content should help move your visitors along your buyer journey. It must result in them taking specific action on your website. To achieve that, you must determine the purpose of your content right from the start. This will help you target the right keywords, meet search intent, and create content that converts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>SEO Copywriting Tips: Use These 10 to Craft Content that Converts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With so much content being published on the internet, getting yours noticed can be a challenge.
